"AIMS" We assessed the effect of concomitant aspirin use on the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" In ARISTOTLE, 18 201 patients were randomized to apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin. Concomitant aspirin use was left to the discretion of the treating physician. In this predefined analysis, simple and marginal structured models were used to adjust for baseline and time-dependent confounders associated with aspirin use. Outcome measures included stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, mortality, major bleeding, haemorrhagic stroke, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and any bleeding. On Day 1, 4434 (24%) patients were taking aspirin. Irrespective of concomitant aspirin use, apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism [with aspirin: apixaban 1.12% vs. warfarin 1.91%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.85 vs. without aspirin: apixaban 1.11% vs. warfarin 1.32%, HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.07; P interaction = 0.10] and caused less major bleeding than warfarin (with aspirin: apixaban 3.10% vs. warfarin 3.92%, HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.99 vs. without aspirin: apixaban 1.82% vs. warfarin 2.78%, HR without aspirin 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.78; P interaction = 0.29). Similar results were seen in the subgroups of patients with and without arterial vascular disease.: "" Apixaban had similar beneficial effects on stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding compared with warfarin, irrespective of concomitant aspirin use.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" The main objective of the present analysis was to assess the effect of treatment with aspirin compared with apixaban on ischemic stroke and major bleeding in women compared with men. Female patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased stroke risk compared with male patients, and the underlying reasons for higher risk are uncertain.METHODS:  Ancillary analysis of the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid [ASA] to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial, comparing aspirin and apixaban, focused on sex differences. Mean follow-up was 1.1 years.RESULTS:  Women compared with men tended to be older (aspirin, 71.8 versus 68.8 years; apixaban, 71.4 versus 68.6 years), with a higher proportion of those aged≥75 years. Also, women had less peripheral artery disease (aspirin, 2.4% versus 3.7%; apixaban, 1.4% versus 3.0%), more heart failure, and higher mean CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age of 75 years or older, diabetes [1 point each], stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points]) scores (aspirin, 2.2 versus 2.0; apixaban, 2.1 versus 2.0). Women compared with men had higher ischemic stroke rates (aspirin, 3.99% versus 2.28%; apixaban, 1.55% versus 0.82%) but similar bleeding rates (aspirin, 1.29% versus 1.22%; apixaban, 1.15% versus 1.36%). The relative effect of apixaban compared with aspirin was similar in men and women for both ischemic stroke (women, 3.99% versus 1.55%; hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.64; men, 2.28% versus 0.82%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.63; Pint=0.84) and major bleeding (women, 1.29% versus 1.15%; hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-2.23; men, 1.36% versus 1.22%; hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-2.02; Pint=0.96).S:  Female patients with atrial fibrillation had higher ischemic stroke rates compared with male patients, but the relative effects of apixaban compared with aspirin on both ischemic stroke and bleeding were similar in men and women.
"S" The goal of this study was to assess the offset of the antiplatelet effects of prasugrel and clopidogrel.BACKGROUND:  Guidelines recommend discontinuing clopidogrel at least 5 days and prasugrel at least 7 days before surgery. The pharmacodynamic basis for these recommendations is limited.METHODS:  Aspirin-treated patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to either prasugrel 10 mg or clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 7 days. Platelet reactivity was measured before study drug administration and for up to 12 days during washout. The primary endpoint was the cumulative proportion of patients returning to baseline reactivity after study drug discontinuation.RESULTS:  A total of 56 patients were randomized; 54 were eligible for analysis. Platelet reactivity was lower 24 h after the last dose of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel. After prasugrel, ≥75% of patients returned to baseline reactivity by washout day 7 compared with day 5 after clopidogrel. Recovery time was dependent on the level of platelet reactivity before study drug exposure and the initial degree of platelet inhibition after study drug discontinuation but not on treatment assignment.
This study is aimed at investigating the association of HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 variability with the response to aspirin desensitization (AD). A total of 16 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory diseases (AERD, 81.3% were female) with median age of 29 ± 4.3 years were included in this study. Following 6 months, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22), medication, symptom scores, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (all p < 0.001) improved significantly. However, only seven patients (43.7%) had clinically significant improvement in all of the medication and symptom scores and FEV1, who were considered responders to AD. Responders to AD had significantly higher symptom scores compared with non-responders at baseline (20 ± 1.18 vs 10 ± 1.27; p = 0.003). HLADQB1*0302 was significantly lower in non-responders than in responders to AD (0.12 [0.02-0.76]; p = 0.022). Sensitivity and specificity of HLA-DQB1*0302 to predict response to AD was 71.4% (95% CI: 35.8-91.7) and 81.8% (95% CI: 52.3-94.8). This study introduces HLA-DQB1*0302 as a genetic marker for favorable response to AD. 
Symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common complication following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), in which less than 1% of these patients suffer from clinically evident pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE can increase other morbidities of coronary revascularization from short to long period, but no clear consensus still exists regarding proper thromboprophylaxis strategy in the literatures. This study was designed to compare the anti-platelet prophylaxis of aspirin plus heparin with heparin alone on asymptomatic perioperative DVT in patients that are candidates for elective off-pump CABG.METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients, who are candidates for elective off-pump CABG, were randomly assigned to two groups: the aspirin plus heparin group (Group 1, n = 60) that received 80 mg daily aspirin orally and 5000 U unfractionated heparin per 8 h subcutaneously from admission to discharge time, and the heparin group (group 2, n = 60) that received same dose of heparin alone. All patients underwent right and left leg venous ultrasound examination during hospitalization, after which post-operative off-pump CABG complications such as deep vein thrombosis, bleeding and pulmonary embolism were evaluated in this study cases.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.10 ± 10.71 years with a male to female ratio of 2.24. Asymptomatic DVT occurred in 12 (10%) patients who underwent elective off-pump CABG. DVT was found more in Group 2 (16.6%) as compared to Group 1 (3.3%) with statistical significant difference (p = 0.015). Bleeding was detected in 5 (4.1%) cases in the patients sampled in this study (p = 0.34), 4 cases of which are from Group 1 and 1 case from Group 2. However, PE was shown in none of this study cases.S: The incidence of DVT decreased more with aspirin plus heparin as compared to heparin alone in patients who underwent elective off-pump CABG. As regards the results obtained in this study, more studies need to be conducted to establish this strategy for prophylaxis of DVT in CABG.
 The use of combined therapy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant versus anticoagulant alone to reduce instances of thromboembolic events in patients with heart valve prostheses is an established standard of care in many countries but not in Egypt. A previous Markov model cost-effectiveness study on Egyptian patients aged 50-60 years demonstrated that the combined therapy reduces the overall treatment cost. However, due to the lack of actual real-world data on cost-effectiveness and the limitation of the Markov model study to 50- to 60-year-old patients, the Egyptian medical community is still questioning whether the added benefit is worth the cost.: "" To assess, from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the cost-effectiveness of the combined use of warfarin and low-dose aspirin (75 mg) versus that of warfarin alone in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses who began therapy between the age of 15 and 50 years.METHODS:  An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combined therapy in patients with mechanical valve prostheses. A total of 316 patients aged between 15 and 50 years were included in the study and randomly assigned to a group treated with both warfarin and aspirin or a group treated with warfarin alone.RESULTS:  The patients in the combined therapy group exhibited a significantly longer duration of protection against the first event. Fewer primary events were observed in the patients treated with warfarin plus aspirin than in those treated with warfarin alone (1.4 %/year, vs. 4.8 %/year), and a higher mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) value over 4 years was obtained for the group treated with warfarin plus aspirin (difference 0.058; 95 % CI 0.013-0.118), although this difference did not reach a conventional level of statistical significance. The total costs over a 4-year period were lower with the combined therapy (difference -US$244; 95 % CI -US$483.1 to -US$3.8), which yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -US$4206 per QALY gained. Thus, the combined therapy was dominant. All costs were reported in US dollars (USD) for the financial year 2014.S:  The results of this analysis indicate that from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the addition of aspirin to the typical warfarin therapy is more effective and less costly for patients with mechanical valve prostheses than treatment with warfarin alone. This combined strategy could be adopted to prevent the complications of mechanical valve prostheses. Our study adds to the body of evidence supporting the option of warfarin-plus-aspirin therapy for patients with mechanical valve prostheses.
"STUDY " To compare the live birth rate of women presented with recurrent miscarriages in the first trimester due to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), randomized to either low molecular weight heparin (Bemiparin) or low dose aspirin (LDA) and to determine the maternal and fetal adverse effects in both treatment groups.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A clinical comparative study was conducted in Maternity teaching Hospital, Erbil city, north of Iraq, Kurdistan region from 15th of September 2007 to the 1st of August 2010 on 141 women presented with 2 or more consecutive miscarriages due to APS, the women randomized to receive either prophylactic dose of Bemiparin with the diagnosis of pregnancy or LDA started preconceptioally and until 36 weeks gestation. The primary outcome was live birth rate in both treatment groups, the secondary outcomes were maternal and fetal complications in both trial groups.RESULT: "RESULT" There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic characters (age groups, parity, gestational age and history of previous abortion), and mode of delivery of the viable newborns. There was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding live birth rate. The proportions of women who gave birth to a live infant were 72.13% in the LDA group and 86.25% in the Hibor group, the mean difference between the live birth rate in both group was 0.141 (95% Confidence interval of the difference, 0.08, 0.274). The average birth weight for women received LDA was significantly lower than women who received Bemiparin.: "" The use of the new second generation LMWH (Bemiparin) in comparison to LDA during pregnancy for prevention of recurrent miscarriage in women with APS is a safe, reliable method with a high live birth rate and no maternal and fetal complications.
 Aspirin and clopidogrel resistance plays a significant role in the development of cardiovascular ischemic events for ninety patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Recent studies have indicated that increasing the dose of antiplatelet drugs maybe a potent method to improve the inhibition of platelet aggregation.METHODS:  Thrombelastograph (TEG) determinations were used to evaluate the effect of antiplatelet therapy. According to the results, 90 patients were divided into three groups and given different doses of aspirin and clopidogrel. Thirty patients with both an inhibition rate of aspirin > 50% and an inhibition rate of clopidogrel > 50% were defined as the control group. Sixty patients with an inhibition rate for aspirin < 50% and an inhibition rate for clopidogrel < 50% were defined as the resistance group. Patients in resistance group were randomly assigned to be given a routine dose (100 mg aspirin plus 75 mg clopidogrel per day, which we called a resistance plus routine dose group, R + R) and a loading dose (200 mg aspirin and 150 mg clopidogrel per day, which we called resistance plus loading dose group, R + L) of antiplatelet therapy. A 12-month follow-up was observed to examine the change of inhibition rate of antiplatelet therapy and to estimate the relationship between inhibition rate and the occurrence of cardiovascular ischemic events.RESULTS:  After 6 months of antiplatelet therapy, the inhibition rate of aspirin in the R + L group increased from (31.4 ± 3.7)% to (68.6 ± 7.1)%, which was significantly higher than that in R + R group, (51.9 ± 8.2)% (P < 0.01). The inhibition rate of clopidogrel in the R + L group increased from (22.1 ± 3.8)% to (60.2 ± 7.4)%, which was significantly higher than in the R + R group, (45.9 ± 4.3)% (P < 0.01). The occurrence rates of cardiovascular ischemic events, stent thrombosis, recurrent unstable angina and myocardial infarction in the R + R group were 20%, 36% and 17%, respectively. Occurrence was significantly increased compared with that in the control group, 3%, 10% and 1%, respectively (P < 0.01). In contrast, the occurrence rates in the R + L group (10%, 23% and 6%, respectively) were attenuated compared with those in the R + R group (P < 0.01), although still higher than in the control group (P < 0.01).S:  Almost all of the cardiovascular ischemic events occurred in the first six months after percutaneous coronary intervention. According to the result of TEG determinations, earlier application of a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel can decrease the rate of recurrent cardiovascular ischemic events.
"" To determine the individual variability in the response to aspirin and/or clopidogrel and its impact on graft patency after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.DESIGN: "DESIGN" A single-centre prospective randomised controlled study designed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. Randomisation was obtained by a computer-generated algorithm.SETTING: "SETTING" University medical school in Italy.PATIENTS: "PATIENTS" 300 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were randomised to receive aspirin (n=150) or aspirin plus clopidogrel (n=150).INTERVENTION: "INTERVENTION" Aspirin 100 mg or aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily was initiated when postoperative chest tube drainage was ≤ 50 ml/h for 2 h and patients were followed up for 12 months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" Qualitative and quantitative assessment of platelet function, angiographic evaluation of coronary revascularisation by 64-slice CT and clinical outcome.RESULTS:  In the aspirin group, 49 patients (32.6%) were aspirin resistant and, in the aspirin-clopidogrel group, 19 patients (12.6%) were aspirin and clopidogrel resistant. The platelet response to aspirin was similar in all aspirin responders despite the study arm (Aspirin Reaction Units 313.2 ± 44.8 vs 323.6 ± 53.6; p=0.07). The platelet response to clopidogrel was enhanced by aspirin in patients responsive to both aspirin and clopidogrel (synergistic effect) compared with responders to clopidogrel only (P2Y12 Reaction Units 139.9 ± 15.5 vs 179.4 ± 18.5; p<0.001). Combined therapy was associated with a reduced vein graft occlusion rate (7.4% vs 13.1%; p=0.04). Antiplatelet resistance was a predictor of graft occlusion (RR 3.6, 95% CI 2.5 to 6.9; p<0.001). Synergistic aspirin and clopidogrel activity was a strong predictor of vein graft patency (RR 5.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 16.3; p<0.01).S:  Combined clopidogrel and aspirin overcome single drug resistances, are safe for bleeding and improve venous graft patency.
This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin, rivaroxaban and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for post total knee arthroplasty (TKA) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Between July 2011 and July 2013, a prospective randomized controlled trial was performed on 324 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent primary unilateral TKA. Twelve hours after the surgery, Group A was given oral rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg/day. Group B was given subcutaneous LMWH at a dose of 4000 AxaIU (0.4 ml)/day and Group C was given oral aspirin at a dose of 100 mg/day. All three groups were treated for 14 days, and all of the patients were followed for 4 weeks. The incidence of DVT, dominant/hidden blood loss, the incidence of wound complications and the incidence of subcutaneous ecchymosis in the affected extremities were compared between the three groups. The incidence of DVT was lower in Group A compared with the other two groups [3 (2.94%) vs. 14 (12.50%), P = 0.029; 3 (2.94%) vs. 18 (16.36%), P = 0.017]. However, hidden blood loss [1.71 (1.19-2.97) vs. 1.18 (0.77-2.31), P = 0.009; 1.71 (1.19-2.97) vs. 1.30 (0.61-2.43), P = 0.004] and wound complications [5 (4.90) vs. 3 (2.67), P = 0.027; 5 (4.90) vs. 2 (1.82), P = 0.014] were more common in Group A than in the other groups. There were no significant differences between Group B and Group C in the incidence of DVT [14 (12.50%) vs. 18 (16.36%), P = 0.831], hidden blood loss [1.18 (0.77-2.31) vs. 1.30 (0.61-2.43), P = 0.327] or wound complications [3 (2.67) vs. 2 (1.82), P = 0.209]. No significant differences in the incidence of limb swelling were found between the three groups [38 (37.25%) vs. 28 (25.00%) vs. 24 (21.82%), P = 0.247]. Group A had a higher incidence of subcutaneous ecchymosis in the affected extremities than Group C [74 (72.55%) vs. 54 (49.09%), P = 0.039], but there were no significant differences between Groups A and B [74 (72.55%) vs. 62 (55.36%), P = 0.193] or between Groups B and C [62 (55.36%) vs. 54 (49.09%), P = 0.427]. Rivaroxaban has a positive anticoagulation effect but leads to increases in both postoperative blood loss and wound complications in patients. Hence, clinicians using rivaroxaban for anticoagulant therapy should closely monitor the changes in the hemoglobin level and wound healing and promptly supplement blood volume and provide other symptomatic and supportive treatments. No significant difference in post-TKA DVT prophylaxis was found between aspirin and LMWH, and the former can be used as part of a multimodal anticoagulation therapy. 
 There is substantial variability in the perioperative administration of aspirin in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, both among patients who are already on an aspirin regimen and among those who are not.METHODS:  Using a 2-by-2 factorial trial design, we randomly assigned 10,010 patients who were preparing to undergo noncardiac surgery and were at risk for vascular complications to receive aspirin or placebo and clonidine or placebo. The results of the aspirin trial are reported here. The patients were stratified according to whether they had not been taking aspirin before the study (initiation stratum, with 5628 patients) or they were already on an aspirin regimen (continuation stratum, with 4382 patients). Patients started taking aspirin (at a dose of 200 mg) or placebo just before surgery and continued it daily (at a dose of 100 mg) for 30 days in the initiation stratum and for 7 days in the continuation stratum, after which patients resumed their regular aspirin regimen. The primary outcome was a composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days.RESULTS:  The primary outcome occurred in 351 of 4998 patients (7.0%) in the aspirin group and in 355 of 5012 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the aspirin group, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 1.15; P=0.92). Major bleeding was more common in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (230 patients [4.6%] vs. 188 patients [3.8%]; hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01, to 1.49; P=0.04). The primary and secondary outcome results were similar in the two aspirin strata.
 Ticagrelor is an effective antiplatelet therapy for patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease and might be more effective than aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischaemia of atherosclerotic origin. Our aim was to test for a treatment-by-ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis interaction in a subgroup analysis of patients in the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes (SOCRATES) trial.METHODS: SOCRATES was a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of ticagrelor versus aspirin in patients aged 40 years or older with a non-cardioembolic, non-severe acute ischaemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischaemic attack from 674 hospitals in 33 countries. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-90, given orally) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2-90, given orally) within 24 h of symptom onset. Investigators classified all patients into atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic groups for the prespecified, exploratory analysis reported in this study. The primary endpoint was the time to occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. The SOCRATES trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01994720" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT01994720</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between Jan 7, 2014, and Oct 29, 2015, we randomly allocated 13 199 patients (6589 [50%] to ticagrelor and 6610 [50%] to aspirin). Potentially symptomatic ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis was reported in 3081 (23%) of 13 199 patients. We found a treatment-by-atherosclerotic stenosis interaction (p=0·017). 103 (6·7%) of 1542 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group and 147 (9·6%) of 1539 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the aspirin group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days (hazard ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·53-0·88]; p=0·003). In 10 118 patients with no ipsilateral stenosis, 339 (6·7%) of 5047 patients in the ticagrelor group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days compared with 350 (6·9%) of 5071 in the aspirin group (0·97 [0·84-1·13]; p=0·72). There were no significant differences in the proportion of life-threatening bleeding or major or minor bleeding events in patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group compared with the aspirin group.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" In this prespecified exploratory analysis, ticagrelor was superior to aspirin at preventing stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack when associated with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. An understanding of stroke mechanisms and causes is important to deliver safe and efficacious treatments for early stroke prevention.FUNDING: "FUNDING" AstraZeneca.
Laropiprant is an antagonist of the prostaglandin PGD2 receptor DP1. Laropiprant has a weak affinity for the thromboxane A2 receptor TP. Two double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies evaluated the effects of multiple-dose laropiprant at steady state on the antiplatelet effects of multiple-dose aspirin and clopidogrel. Study 1 had two treatment periods, in which each healthy subject received laropiprant 40 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and aspirin 80 mg (Treatment A), or placebo, clopidogrel 75 mg, and aspirin 80 mg (Treatment B) once daily for 7 days. Study 2 consisted of three treatment periods. In the first two, each patient with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia received laropiprant 40 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and aspirin 81 mg (Treatment A), or placebo, clopidogrel 75 mg, and aspirin 81 mg (Treatment B) once daily for 7 days. In period 3, patients received a single dose of two tablets of extended release nicotinic acid 1 g/laropiprant 20 mg (Treatment C). In both studies, pharmacodynamic endpoints included bleeding time at 24 (primary) and 4 hours (secondary) post-dose following 7 days of once-daily laropiprant in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin, and platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma at 4 and 24 hours post-dose on day 7 (secondary). After 7 days, increased bleeding time of 27% (Study 1) and 23% (Study 2) at 24 hours post-dose was observed with laropiprant compared to placebo (both combined with clopidogrel and aspirin), with corresponding upper bounds of the 90% CI marginally exceeding the prespecified upper comparability bound of 1.50 in both studies. The GMR and 90% CI for bleeding time of laropiprant compared to placebo (both combined with clopidogrel and aspirin) at 4 hours post-dose on day 7 was 0.92 (0.70, 1.21) in Study 1, and 1.46 (1.20, 1.78) in Study 2. Compared with placebo, laropiprant (both combined with clopidogrel and aspirin) increased the inhibition of collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation, respectively, by ∼2.4% and ∼8.1% in Study 1 and by ∼4% and ∼5.4% in Study 2, at 24 hours post-dose on day 7. The inhibition of collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation, respectively, was increased by ∼0.1% and ∼5.0% in Study 1, and by ∼5% and ∼12% in Study 2, at 4 hours post-dose on day 7. In conclusion, co-administration of multiple doses of laropiprant with aspirin and clopidogrel induced a prolongation of bleeding time and an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation ex vivo in healthy subjects and patients with dyslipidemia.
"" Current stroke risk schemes need improvement of predictive value in patients with atrial fibrillation. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may facilitate stroke risk assessment in such patients and guide antithrombotic treatment.METHODS:  We randomised 238 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a moderate stroke risk to aspirin or adjusted vitamin K antagonist therapy after TEE had ruled out thrombogenic features in the atria and aorta. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, major bleeding, peripheral embolism and all-cause mortality.RESULTS:  Mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.1±1.1. The incidences of the composite primary outcome at a mean follow-up of 1.6 years were 3.2% (2.02% per year) in the aspirin group compared to 6.1% (3.84% per year) in the vitamin K antagonists group with an absolute advantage of 2.9 percentage points. Aspirin was non-inferior to vitamin K antagonists (p<0.0001) because the upper limit of the 90% CI did not exceed the 7% absolute difference in event rate between the two treatment arms.S:  This hypothesis-generating pilot trial has found that TEE may be used for refinement of stroke risk in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients. A larger trial is needed to confirm these data. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NTC00224757).
"IMPORTANCE" The occurrence of new-onset migraine attacks is a complication of transcatheter atrial septal defect (ASD) closure. It has been suggested that clopidogrel may reduce migraine attacks after ASD closure.: "" To assess the efficacy of clopidogrel, used in addition to taking aspirin, for the prevention of migraine attacks following ASD closure.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" Randomized, double-blind clinical trial performed in 6 university hospitals in Canada. Participants were 171 patients with an indication for ASD closure and no history of migraine.INTERVENTIONS: "INTERVENTIONS" Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel [the clopidogrel group], n = 84) vs single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + placebo [the placebo group], n = 87) for 3 months following transcatheter ASD closure. The first patient was enrolled in December 2008, and the last follow-up was completed in February 2015.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" The primary efficacy outcome was the monthly number of migraine days within the 3 months following ASD closure in the entire study population. The incidence and severity of new-onset migraine attacks, as evaluated by the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire, were prespecified secondary end points. A zero-inflated Poisson regression model was used for data analysis.RESULTS:  The mean (SD) age of the participants was 49 (15) years and 62% (106) were women. Patients in the clopidogrel group had a reduced mean (SD) number of monthly migraine days within the 3 months following the procedure (0.4 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.69] days) vs the placebo group (1.4 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.26] days; difference, -1.02 days [95% CI, -1.94 to -0.10 days]; incident risk ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.91]; P = .04) and a lower incidence of migraine attacks following ASD closure (9.5% for the clopidogrel group vs 21.8% for the placebo group; difference, -12.3% [95% CI, -23% to -1.6%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.89]; P = .03). Among patients with migraines, those in the clopidogrel group had less-severe migraine attacks (zero patients with moderately or severely disabling migraine attacks vs 37% [7 patients] in the placebo group; difference, -36.8% [95% CI, -58.5% to -15.2%]; P = .046). There were no between-group differences in the rate of patients with at least 1 adverse event (16.7% [14 patients] in the clopidogrel group vs 21.8% [19 patients] in the placebo group; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -17% to 6.6%]; P = .44).S AND RELEVANCE: "S AND RELEVANCE" Among patients who underwent transcatheter ASD closure, the use of clopidogrel and aspirin, compared with aspirin alone, resulted in a lower monthly frequency of migraine attacks over 3 months. Further studies are needed to assess generalizability and durability of this effect.
"BACKGROUND AND AIM" Proton-pump inhibitors are known to be effective in the treatment and prevention of ulcers related to low-dose aspirin (LDA), but few reports address H2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and gastroprotective agents (GPs). This study was intended to compare the therapeutic effects of an H2RA and a GP against gastroduodenal mucosal injuries in patients taking LDA.METHODS:  The subjects consisted of patients requiring continuous LDA treatment, in whom no peptic ulcer was found on endoscopy at enrollment. The patients were randomized to either famotidine 20 mg/day (group F) or teprenone 150 mg/day (group T). The study medication was administered for 12 weeks. The patients underwent endoscopy after administration of the study medication in order to obtain a Lanza score.RESULTS:  A total of 66 patients (38 in group F, 28 in group T) were included in the efficacy analysis population. The Lanza score changed as follows: in group F, it improved significantly, from 0.89±1.03 (mean±standard deviation) before medication to 0.39±0.75 after medication (P=0.006); in group T, no significant difference was observed: 0.75±0.93 before medication and 0.68±0.82 after medication.: "" Famotidine is better than teprenone in terms of reducing the number of the erosions under use of LDA.
"S" Aspirin may be involved in microscopic colitis (MC) development, but there are no data on colon histology in asymptomatic aspirin users. We prospectively assessed colonic and rectal mucosa from aspirin users, searching for MC features.METHODS:  From colonoscopy screenees, two biopsy samples were taken from each of three locations: ascending colon, transverse colon and rectum. A pathologist measured chronicity of inflammation and activity indicators, epithelial cell height and subepithelial collagen layer width. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), intralaminal eosinophils and apoptotic cells/100 crypts were counted. Panel data models were used to analyse associations between aspirin use, biopsy location and microscopic parameters.RESULTS:  Of 100 screenees (age: 40-65 years), 42 were current aspirin users. Median duration of aspirin usage was 48 months (range: 36-60) with dosage ranging from 75-325 mg/day. We observed reduced epithelium polymorphs in subjects who used aspirin for <48 months versus non-users (p=0.008). Paneth cell metaplasia was significantly less frequent in aspirin users versus non-users (p=0.006). Inflammatory cells in lamina propria (eosinophils) and epithelium (IELs) were most abundant in the ascending colon and decreased distally (ascending colon vs transverse colon and transverse colon vs rectum). Cryptitis was more frequent in the ascending colon vs the rectum.S:  We observed no specific MC features in asymptomatic chronic low-dose aspirin users. We found subtle physiological and histopathological differences between the bowel segments.
Aspirin has been shown to protect against colorectal neoplasms; however, the optimal chemopreventive dose and underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to study the relationship between prostanoid metabolites and aspirin's effect on adenoma occurrence. We used data from the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, in which 1,121 participants with a recent adenoma were randomized to placebo or two doses of aspirin (81 or 325 mg/d) to be taken until the next surveillance colonoscopy, anticipated about 3 years later. Urinary metabolites of prostanoids (PGE-M, PGI-M, and dTxB2) were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry or GC/NICI-MS in 876 participants near the end of treatment follow-up. Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to calculate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. PGE-M, PGI-M, and dTxB2 levels were 28%, 37%, and 60% proportionately lower, respectively, in individuals who took 325 mg of aspirin compared with individuals who took placebo (all P < 0.001). Similarly, among individuals who took 81 mg of aspirin, PGE-M, PGI-M, and dTxB2 were, respectively, 18%, 30%, and 57% proportionally lower compared with placebo (all P < 0.005). None of the metabolites or their ratios were statistically significantly associated with the risk of adenoma occurrence. The effect of aspirin in reducing adenoma risk was independent of prostanoid levels. Aspirin use is associated with lower levels of urinary prostanoid metabolites. However, our findings do not support the hypothesis that these metabolites are associated with adenoma occurrence, suggesting that COX-dependent mechanisms may not completely explain the chemopreventive effect of aspirin on colorectal neoplasms.
 Among patients without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and low 10-year CVD risk, the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes associated with aspirin use outweigh any potential atheroprotective benefit. According to the guidelines on primary prevention of CVD, aspirin use is considered appropriate only in patients with 10-year CVD risk ≥6% and inappropriate in patients with 10-year CVD risk <6%.S: "S" The goal of this study was to examine the frequency and practice-level variation in inappropriate aspirin use for primary prevention in a large U.S. nationwide registry.METHODS:  Within the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry's Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry, we assessed 68,808 unique patients receiving aspirin for primary prevention from 119 U.S. practices. The frequency of inappropriate aspirin use was determined for primary prevention (aspirin use in those with 10-year CVD risk <6%). Using hierarchical regression models, the extent of practice-level variation using the median rate ratio (MRR) was assessed.RESULTS:  Inappropriate aspirin use frequency was 11.6% (7,972 of 68,808) in the overall cohort. There was significant practice-level variation in inappropriate use (range 0% to 71.8%; median 10.1%; interquartile range 6.4%) for practices; adjusted MRR was 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47 to 1.77). Results remained consistent after excluding 21,052 women age ≥65 years (inappropriate aspirin use 15.2%; median practice-level inappropriate aspirin use 13.8%; interquartile range 8.2%; adjusted MRR 1.61 [95% CI: 1.46 to 1.75]) and after excluding patients with diabetes (inappropriate aspirin use 13.9%; median practice-level inappropriate aspirin use 12.4%; interquartile range 7.6%; adjusted MRR 1.55 [95% CI: 1.41 to 1.67]).S:  More than 1 in 10 patients in this national registry were receiving inappropriate aspirin therapy for primary prevention, with significant practice-level variations. Our findings suggest that there are important opportunities to improve evidence-based aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD.
 Microvascular obstruction seems to predict poor outcome in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We analyzed whether serum thromboxane B2, a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2, may be implicated in post-PCI microvascular obstruction.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We enrolled 91 patients (74 males, 66±10 years) on chronic low-dose aspirin therapy (aspirin, 100 mg daily) scheduled for elective PCI and randomly assigned to receive aspirin reload (325 mg orally, n=46) or no reload (control group, n=45) ≥1 hour before elective PCI. Serum levels of thromboxane B2, reperfusion indexes (corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count and myocardial blush grade), and serum cardiac troponin I were assessed before and after PCI. Serum thromboxane B2 significantly increased after 120 minutes (P=0.0447) from PCI in control but not in aspirin reload group. After PCI, both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count more evident in aspirin reload group (P=0.0023). Moreover, after PCI, 61% of patients allocated to aspirin reload and only 32% of patients allocated to control group reached normal microcirculatory reperfusion (myocardial blush grade=3); patients with myocardial blush grade=3 exhibited lower values of serum thromboxane B2 compared with those with myocardial blush grade <3 (P=0.05). Periprocedural cardiac troponin I significantly increased (F=3.64; P=0.01334) and correlated with serum thromboxane B2 (ρ=0.31; P=0.0413) in control but not in aspirin reload group. In addition, left ventricular ejection fraction significantly increased after PCI only in the aspirin reload group (P=0.0005).S:  Aspirin loading dose before elective PCI improves myocardial reperfusion and injury indexes, suggesting a possible role of platelet thromboxane A2 in microvascular occlusion.
"" To estimate the effect of early administration of aspirin on the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk women.METHODS:  This was planned as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin for women with risk factors for pre-eclampsia. Participants were randomized to start either aspirin (81 mg/day) or placebo at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was pre-eclampsia and secondary outcomes included gestational hypertension and small-for-gestational age at birth.RESULTS:  The trial suffered from slow recruitment, leading to a protocol change to broaden the inclusion criteria (from a minimum score of multiple risk factors to at least one risk factor for pre-eclampsia). The trial was then terminated prematurely due to continuing slow recruitment and a lack of equipoise given a change in national guidelines to administer aspirin to high-risk women. From the 53 women who were randomized, 30 were included in the final analysis. There was no evidence that the primary outcome of pre-eclampsia was prevented by low-dose aspirin (relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.21-3.66). Gestational hypertension was seen in two women, both in the aspirin group. There was no evidence that the occurrence of small-for-gestational age was reduced by aspirin (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.06-12.72).S:  Although this study was underpowered to show effectiveness of aspirin compared to placebo due to the premature termination and difficulties encountered, it highlights practical issues to inform future studies.
"S" The objectives of this study are to examine the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin (LDA) vs LDA plus low-intensity warfarin (LDA + W) in the primary thrombosis prevention of aPL-positive patients with SLE and/or obstetric morbidity and the role of clinical and serological markers in the development of thrombosis.METHODS:  In this 5-year prospective, randomized, open, controlled trial, 166 patients with aPL were randomly assigned using a minimization protocol to receive treatment with LDA (n = 82) or LDA + W [international normalized ratio (INR) = 1.5] (n = 84). Sixty-six patients who declined randomization were followed up in an observational arm. Clinical and laboratory characteristics and medication side effects were recorded.RESULTS:  There were no differences in the number of thromboses between patients treated with LDA (4/82) or LDA + W (4/84) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.27, 4.3]. The incidence of thrombosis in the randomized patients was 8/166 (1.8 events/100 person-years) (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.27, 4.3) and in the observational arm was 7/66 (4.9 events/100 person-years) (HR 2.43, 95% CI 0.87, 6.79). Sixty-five of 66 patients included in the observational arm received LDA. None of the examined clinical or serological factors appeared to predict thrombosis. Medication side effects included mild gastrointestinal symptoms in the LDA group (n = 2) and bleeding in the LDA + W group (n = 11; 1 nasal and 10 menorrhagia). The risk difference for bleeding was 13% (CI 6, 20).: "" No differences in the number of thromboses were observed between patients treated with LDA vs those treated with LDA + W. More episodes of bleeding were detected in the LDA + W group. The LDA + W regime was significantly less safe and not as acceptable as LDA alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" ISRCTN81818945; http://isrctn.org/.
"" To investigate the feasibility of continuation of aspirin before tooth extraction in the elderly.METHODS:  The patients enrolled in this study were the elderly requiring a single non-impacted tooth extraction. 300 elderly outpatients used lidocaine local infiltration anesthesia, 200 patients without using aspirin before tooth extraction served as control group I, 100 patients with prolong use of aspirin before tooth extraction as observation group I. 300 elderly outpatients used compound articaine local infiltration anesthesia, 200 patients without using aspirin before tooth extraction served as control group II, 100 patients with prolong use of aspirin before tooth extraction as observation group II.Bleedings at 5, 10, 30 min, 24 h after tooth extraction were observed and the relationship between postoperative bleeding and intake of aspirin was analyzed.RESULTS:  There was no significant difference at 5, 10, 30 min, 24 h in postoperative bleeding after extraction between control group I and observation group. The incidence of bleeding of observation group II after tooth extraction at 5 min was higher than that of control group II and there was no significant difference at 10, 30 min, 24 h between the two groups.S:  Continuation of aspirin have no influence on postoperative bleeding. Therefore we suggest that there was no indication to discontinue aspirin for the elderly before a single non-impacted tooth extraction.
 There are few data that demonstrate a significant effect of aspirin therapy for diabetic patients. To clarify the effect of the primary prevention of aspirin therapy in diabetic patients, the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and the incidence of atherosclerotic events was investigated in participants in the Japanese primary prevention of atherosclerosis with aspirin for diabetes (JPAD) trial.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We divided the JPAD participants according to their systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BPs at enrollment (SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg: unattained group, SBP <140 mmHg and DBP <90 mmHg: attained group). The incidence of the primary atherosclerotic events, especially cerebrovascular events, was higher in the unattained group than in the attained group. The incidence of cerebrovascular events was higher in the unattained group than in the attained group in patients without aspirin therapy; however, the incidence of cerebrovascular events in the unattained group was as low as the incidence in the attained group in patients undergoing aspirin therapy. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that BP level was an independent predictor for cerebrovascular events in diabetic patients.S:  Aspirin therapy may reduce cerebrovascular events in diabetic patients with higher BP. Aspirin therapy could be an additional strategy as primary prevention for diabetic patients with higher BP.
 Few studies have evaluated the effects of rabeprazole on low-dose aspirin (LDA)-induced gastroduodenal injuries.AIM: "AIM" To conduct a randomised, double-blind, triple-dummy, active-controlled, multicentre trial, named the PLANETARIUM study, to assess the efficacy, dose-response relationship and safety of rabeprazole for peptic ulcer recurrence in Japanese patients on long-term LDA therapy.METHODS:  Eligible patients had a history of endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcers and were receiving long-term LDA (81 or 100 mg/day) therapy for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular protection. Subjects were randomly segregated into three groups receiving rabeprazole 10 mg once daily (standard dose in Japan), rabeprazole 5 mg once daily, or teprenone (geranylgeranylacetone; mucosal protective agent commercially available in Japan) 50 mg three times per day as an active control. The primary endpoint was recurrence of peptic ulcers over 24 weeks.RESULTS:  Among 472 randomised subjects, 452 subjects (n = 151, 150, 151, respectively) constituted the full analysis set. The cumulative recurrence rates of peptic ulcers over 24 weeks in the 10- and 5-mg rabeprazole groups were 1.4% and 2.8%, respectively, both of which were significantly lower than that in the teprenone group (21.7%). The cumulative occurrence rate of bleeding ulcers over 24 weeks in the teprenone group was 4.6%, while bleeding ulcers were not observed in the 10- or 5-mg rabeprazole groups. Rabeprazole was well tolerated at both doses.: "" Rabeprazole prevents the recurrence of peptic ulcers with no evidence of a major dose-response effect in subjects on low-dose aspirin therapy.
 The use of low-dose aspirin (LDA) has emerged as an important cause of gastrointestinal ulcers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between LDA-induced gastric mucosal injury and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cell apoptosis in elderly Chinese patients.METHODS:  A total of 136 patients aged 60 to 80 years with LDA-induced (100 mg/d for at least 1 month) gastric mucosal injury and 48 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a low-severity group and a high-severity group based on their modified Lanza scale scores. Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa from all participants were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for VEGF expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining for cell apoptosis. Staining indices and apoptotic indices were applied to assess VEGF expression level and the extent of cell apoptosis.RESULTS:  VEGF expression decreased significantly in the 2 patient groups, whereas the extent of cell apoptosis significantly increased compared with the control group. Furthermore, Spearman's correlation coefficients suggest that VEGF expression levels and the extent of cell apoptosis in gastric mucosae shared a significant correlation with the severity of LDA-induced gastric mucosal injury. Receiver operating characteristics analysis further confirmed these results.S:  Our findings provide important clues as to the underlying molecular mechanism behind gastric mucosal injury resulting from exposure to LDA in elderly adults, and also suggest that interventions specifically targeting the pathways associated with angiogenesis and apoptosis may help facilitate the healing process.
 Simultaneous prescription of clopidogrel and low-dose aspirin is recommended for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome because of improvements in efficacy and patient compliance. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of clopidogrel and aspirin was compared with coadministration of individual formulations to clarify the equivalence of the FDC.METHODS:  This was a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy Korean men aged 20-55 years. Subjects received two FDC capsules of clopidogrel/aspirin 75/100 mg (test) or two tablets of clopidogrel 75 mg and two capsules of aspirin 100 mg (reference) with a 14-day washout period. Plasma concentrations of clopidogrel, aspirin, and salicylic acid were measured using validated ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Bioequivalence was assessed by analysis of variance and calculation of the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratios of the geometric means (GMRs) for AUC<sublast</sub and <iC</i<submax</sub for clopidogrel and aspirin.RESULTS:  Sixty healthy subjects were enrolled, and 53 completed the study. Clopidogrel, aspirin, and salicylic acid showed similar absorption profiles and no significant differences in <iC</i<submax</sub, AUC<sublast</sub, and <iT</i<submax</sub between FDC administration and coadministration of individual formulations. The GMRs (90% CI) for the <iC</i<submax</sub and AUC<sublast</sub of clopidogrel were 1.08 (0.95, 1.23) and 0.93 (0.84, 1.03), respectively. The GMRs (90% CI) for the <iC</i<submax</sub and AUC<sublast</sub of aspirin were 0.98 (0.84, 1.13) and 0.98 (0.93, 1.04), respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated in the study subjects.: "" The FDC of clopidogrel and aspirin was bioequivalent to coadministration of each individual formulation. The FDC capsule exhibited similar safety and tolerability profiles to the individual formulations. Therefore, clopidogrel/aspirin 75 mg/100 mg FDC capsules can be prescribed to improve patient compliance.
Floctafenine, a hydroxyquinoline derivative with analgesic properties, is widely used in Thailand and many other countries. The objectives of this study were to evaluate in Thai healthy volunteers: i) the inhibition of whole blood cyclooxygenase(COX)-2 and COX-1 activity by floctafenine and its metabolite floctafenic acid in vitro and ex vivo after dosing with floctafenine; ii) the possible interference of floctafenine administration with aspirin antiplatelet effects. We performed an open-label, cross-over, 3-period study, on 11 healthy Thai volunteers, who received consecutively floctafenine(200mg/TID), low-dose aspirin(81mg/daily) or their combination for 4 days, separated by washout periods. Floctafenine and floctafenic acid resulted potent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro (floctafenic acid was more potent than floctafenine) showing a slight preference for COX-1. After dosing with floctafenine alone, whole blood COX-1 and COX-2 activities were inhibited ex vivo in a time-dependent fashion which paralleled floctafenic acid plasma concentrations. Aspirin alone inhibited profoundly and persistently platelet COX-1 activity and AA-induced platelet aggregation throughout 24-h dosing interval which was affected by the co-administration of floctafenine. At 24 h after dosing with aspirin and floctafenine, the inhibition of platelet thromboxane(TX)B2 generation and aggregation were significantly(P less than 0.05) lower than that caused by aspirin alone. Therapeutic dosing with floctafenine profoundly inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis through the rapid conversion to floctafenic acid. Floctafenine interfered with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. Our results suggest that floctafenine should be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease under treatment with low-dose aspirin.
A graphene modified glassy carbon (GR/GCE) sensor has been developed for the determination of aspirin metabolites 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids (2,3- and 2,5-DHB). The modified sensor was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The electrochemical behavior of 2,3- and 2,5-DHB was investigated by cyclic and square wave voltammetry. The modified sensor exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of 2,3- and 2,5-DHB, leading to a remarkable enhancement in the peak current as compared to the bare sensor. The results were attributed to the enhanced surface area and high conductivity of GR. The anodic peak currents of 2,3- and 2,5-DHB were found to be linear in the concentration range of 1-150 µM and 1-200 µM with the detection limits of 47 nM and 51 nM, respectively. The sensor was capable to determine 2,5-DHB effectively without any interference from the uric acid and other metabolites present in the urine samples. The practical utility of GR/GCE has been successfully demonstrated for the determination of 2,5-DHB in the urine samples of persons undergoing treatment with aspirin.
AIMS To identify women who benefit from aspirin 100 mg on alternate days for primary prevention of vascular events by using treatment effect prediction based on individual patient characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS Randomized controlled trial data from the Women's Health Study were used to predict treatment effects for individual women in terms of absolute risk reduction for major cardiovascular events (i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death). Predictions were based on existing risk scores, i.e. Framingham (FRS), and Reynolds (RRS), and on a newly developed prediction model. The net benefit of different aspirin treatment-strategies was compared: (i) treat no one, (ii) treat everyone, (iii) treatment according to the current guidelines (i.e. selective treatment of women >65 years of age or having >10% FRS), and (iv) prediction-based treatment (i.e. selective treatment of patients whose predicted treatment effect exceeds a given decision threshold). The predicted reduction in 10-year absolute risk for major cardiovascular events was <1% in 97.8% of 27 939 study subjects when based on the refitted FRS, in 97.0% when based on the refitted RRS, and in 90.0% when based on the newly developed model. Of the treatment strategies considered, only prediction-based treatment using the newly developed model and selective treatment of women >65 years of age yielded more net benefit than treating no one, provided that the 10-year number-willing-to-treat (NWT) to prevent one cardiovascular event was above 50.  Aspirin was ineffective or even harmful in the majority of patients. Age was positively related to treatment effect, whereas current smoking and baseline risk for cardiovascular events were not. When the NWT is 50 or lower, the aspirin treatment strategy that is associated with optimal net benefit in primary prevention of vascular events in women is to treat none.
 Aspirin is a primary antiplatelet agent for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. However, if aspirin fails to inhibit platelet function, as is expected in acute ischemic stroke (AIS), it may increase the rate of early clinical events. Therefore, we sought to determine whether aspirin resistance in the acute stage was associated with early radiological events, including new ischemic lesions (NILs).METHODS:  This study was a single-center, prospective, observational study conducted between April 2012 and May 2013. Aspirin 300 mg was initially administered followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg daily. The acute aspirin reaction unit (aARU) was consistently measured after 3 hours of aspirin loading. An aARU value ≥550 IU was defined as biological aspirin resistance (BAR). NILs on follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were defined as lesions separate from index lesions, which were not detected on the initial DWI.RESULTS:  A total of 367 patients were analyzed in this study. BAR in aARU was detected in 60 patients (16.3%). On follow-up DWI, 81 patients (22.1%) had NILs, which were frequently in the same territory as the index lesions (79%), pial infarcts (61.7%), and located within the cortex (59.3%). BAR was independently associated with NILs on follow-up DWI (adjusted OR 2.00, 95% CIs 1.01-3.96; p = 0.047).: "" In conclusion, BAR in aARU could be associated with NILs on follow-up DWI in AIS. Therefore, a further prospective study with a longer follow-up period is necessary to evaluate the clinical implications of aARU in AIS.
Ascorbic acid in combination with aspirin has been used to prevent aspirin-induced oxidative GI damage. We aimed to determine whether ascorbic acid reduces or prevents aspirin-induced changes in intestinal permeability over a 6-hr period using saccharidic probes mannitol and lactulose. The effects of administration of 600 mg aspirin alone, 500 mg ascorbic acid alone and simultaneous dosage of both agents were compared in a cross-over study in 28 healthy female volunteers. These effects were also compared with that of a placebo. The ability of ascorbic acid to mitigate the effects of aspirin when administered either half an hour before or after dosage with aspirin was also assessed in 19 healthy female volunteers. The excretion of lactulose over the 6-hr period was augmented after consumption of either aspirin or ascorbic acid compared with that after consumption of placebo. Dosage with ascorbic acid alone augmented the excretion of lactulose more than did aspirin alone. Simultaneous dosage with both agents augmented the excretion of lactulose in an additive manner. The timing of dosage with ascorbic acid in relation to that with aspirin had no significant effect on the excretion of the two sugars. These findings indicate that ascorbic acid does not prevent aspirin-induced increase in gut permeability rather that both agents augment it to a similar extent. The additive effect on simultaneous dosage with both agents in augmenting the absorption of lactulose suggests that each influences paracellular permeability by different pathways. 
Given conflicting data on temporal variability in pharmacodynamic platelet responses to clopidogrel, we investigated platelet reactivity on clopidogrel and aspirin for up to six months after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents. Platelet reactivity was determined in 102 patients before loading with clopidogrel and aspirin, and on maintenance therapy after PCI on day 1, at one month and six months by VerifyNow™ P2Y12 and Aspirin assays and by residual platelet aggregation (RPA) on light transmission aggregometry using adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid. By VerifyNow testing, median (interquartile range) P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) on clopidogrel were 166 (90-234), 195 (124-257), and 198 (141-252) on day 1, one month and six months after PCI, respectively (p=0.005 day 1 to 1 month, and p=0.86 1 month to 6 months). Using a cut-off of > 208 PRU, 35 % of patients had high platelet reactivity (HPR) to clopidogrel on day 1, 43 % at one month, and 46 % at six months after PCI. Between day 1 and six months after PCI, 38.2 % of patients changed clopidogrel responder status at least once. Other cut-offs and RPA yielded similar results. Platelet inhibition by aspirin was consistent over time with only five patients being characterised as having HPR. Considerable variation in individual on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity was present during both the subacute and the late phases of maintenance therapy after elective PCI. Hence, the utility of contemporary platelet function testing to guide antiplatelet therapy may be limited. 
Current orthopedic practice requires consideration of contradictory recommendations regarding pulmonary embolism (PE) prevention among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and knee joint arthroplasty (TKA). A total of 696 consecutive patients underwent elective THA or TKA. Two hundred eighty-one patients received PE risk stratification per American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines. Of these patients, 152 standard-risk patients received aspirin, and 129 elevated-risk patients received warfarin. The comparator group of 415 patients received American College of Chest Physicians-recommended warfarin without PE risk stratification. Primary study outcomes were symptomatic PE, deep venous thrombosis, major bleeding, and death. The rate of symptomatic PE and venous thromboembolism among standard-risk group patients receiving aspirin was greater than the comparator group (4.6% vs 0.7% and 7.9% vs 1.2%, respectively). Most events (16/18) occurred among patients undergoing TKA. Patients with total joint arthroplasty at standard risk for PE receiving aspirin had a higher rate of symptomatic PE and venous thromboembolism than did patients receiving anticoagulation.
"INTRODUCTION" There are no published randomized data on secondary prevention in humans about whether aspirin affects nitric oxide (NO) formation. In patients with chronic stable coronary disease, we tested whether aspirin at clinically relevant doses increases NO formation.: "" In a randomized, double-blind trial, 37 patients from 2 cardiology office practices were assigned to daily doses of 81, 162.5, 325, 650, or 1300 aspirin for 12 weeks. Primary prespecified outcome measures were changes in heme oxygenase (HO-1), a downstream target of NO formation, and asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase.RESULTS:  There were no significant differences for HO-1 or ADMA between any of the clinically relevant doses of aspirin tested, so all were combined. For HO-1, there was a significant increase (10.29 ± 2.44, P < .001) from baseline (15.37 ± 1.85) to week 12 (25.66 ± 1.57). The mean ratio (MR) of week 12 to baseline for HO-1 was significantly higher than 1.0 (1.67, confidence interval [CI] from 1.60 to 1.74, P < .001). For ADMA, there was a significant decrease (-0.24 ± 0.11, P < .001) from baseline (0.78 ± 0.08) to week 12 (0.54 ± 0.07). The MR of week 12 to baseline for ADMA was significantly lower than 1.0 (0.69, CI from 0.66 to 0.73, P < .001).S:  In patients with chronic stable coronary disease, all clinically relevant daily doses of aspirin tested, from 81 to 1300 mg, produce similar and statistically significant increases in HO-1 and decreases in ADMA. These are the first randomized data on secondary prevention patients. These data support the hypothesis that aspirin has additional beneficial effects mediated through NO formation. Further research, including direct randomized comparisons on atherosclerosis using noninvasive techniques as well as on occlusive vascular disease events, is necessary.
 Dual antiplatelet therapy is widely used in patients with coronary artery disease and increases the risk of excessive bleeding and transfusion in those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).METHODS:  The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing primary and isolated on-pump CABG with their last dose of clopidogrel and aspirin less than 7 days preoperatively were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg before surgical incision and 15 mg/kg after protamine neutralization) or a corresponding volume of saline solution. The primary outcome was allogeneic erythrocyte transfusion.RESULTS:  Randomly assigned participants were 120 adults among whom 117 were analyzed, 58 in the tranexamic acid group and 59 in the placebo group. As compared with placebo, tranexamic acid reduced allogeneic erythrocyte requirement-both the volume transfused (4.84 ± 5.85 versus 9.36 ± 11.41 units; mean difference -4.52 units; 95% interval confidence [CI], -7.85 to -1.19 units; p < 0.001) and the ratio exposed (72.4% versus 91.5%; risk difference in percentage point, -19.1; 95% CI, -32.6 to -5.59; relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.94; p = 0.007)-blood loss (1069.1 ± 565.5 mL versus 1449.8 ± 899.8 mL; mean difference, -380.7 mL; 95% CI, -656.4 to -104.9 mL; p = 0.005), major bleeding (50.0% versus 78.0%; risk difference, -28.0; 95% CI, -44.6 to -11.3; relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; p = 0.002), and reoperation (0.0% versus 10.2%; risk difference, -10.2; 95% CI, -17.9 to -2.46; relative risk, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.00 to 1.36; p = 0.01).S:  Tranexamic acid significantly reduced blood loss, major bleeding, reoperation, and allogeneic transfusion in patients undergoing primary and isolated on-pump CABG without clopidogrel and aspirin cessation.
"INTRODUCTION" Historically, venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the setting of elective knee arthroscopy has been considered rare. However, more recently, the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been reported to be approximately 10%. With increasing recognition of the potential for the development of thromboembolic events, several randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in reducing the risk of VTE following knee arthroscopy. However, all of these studies have evaluated the efficacy of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), with reductions in the risk of DVT ranging from 65% to 93%, but with the potential side effect of bleeding. At the present time, there have been no randomized studies reported evaluating the utility of aspirin, an agent with a reportedly lower bleeding risk than LMWH, as pharmacologic prophylaxis against VTE after arthroscopic knee surgery.METHODS:  In a single-center, randomized, single-blind prospective trial, the efficacy of aspirin as postoperative pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis was evaluated in a low risk population undergoing knee arthroscopy. One hundred seventy patients were randomized to a treatment group of 325 mg of aspirin daily for 14 days postoperatively (66 patients) or to the control group with no intervention (104 patients). Bilateral, whole leg, compression venous duplex ultrasonography was performed 10 to 14 days postoperatively to document the incidence of DVT. The primary endpoint of the current study was the development of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), and the secondary endpoint was the development of a postoperative complication.RESULTS:  The study cohort was comprised of 104 males (61%) and 66 females (39%) with a mean age of 44.4 ± 14.4 years (range: 18 to 75 years). Within both the aspirin treatment and control groups, the surgical procedures included meniscectomy, ACL reconstruction, chondroplasty, and meniscus repair. No cases of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were identified in either arm of the study during the observation period. Twenty-three patients experienced a complication, including pain or swelling (9%), residual joint line tenderness (3%), arthrofibrosis (0.6%), and instability after a fall (0.6%). Three patients developed knee swelling, two of them in the aspirin group and one of whom required a knee aspiration. However, there was no difference in the development of complications between the two patient populations (p = 0.76, odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-2.56).S:  With no cases of VTE identified in our patient population, the use of aspirin in a low-risk population undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery is not warranted.
 Regular aspirin use reduces colon adenoma and carcinoma incidence. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are involved in aspirin metabolism and clearance, and variant alleles in UGT1A6 have been shown to alter salicylic acid metabolism and risk of colon neoplasia.METHODS:  In a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of 44 healthy men and women, homozygous for UGT1A6*1 or UGT1A6*2, we explored differences between global epithelial and stromal expression, using Affymetrix U133 + 2.0 microarrays and tested effects of 60-day aspirin supplementation (325 mg/d) on epithelial and stromal gene expression and colon prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels.RESULTS:  No statistically significant differences in gene expression were observed in response to aspirin or UGT1A6 genotype, but tissue PGE2 levels were lower with aspirin compared to placebo (p <0.001). Transcripts differentially expressed between epithelium and stroma (N = 4916, P <0.01, false discovery rate <0.001), included a high proportion of genes involved in cell signaling, cellular movement, and cancer. Genes preferentially expressed in epithelium were involved in drug and xenobiotic metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, apoptosis signaling, and ion transport. Genes preferentially expressed in stroma included those involved in inflammation, cellular adhesion, and extracellular matrix production. Wnt-Tcf4 pathway genes were expressed in both epithelium and stroma but differed by subcellular location.S:  These results suggest that, in healthy individuals, subtle effects of aspirin on gene expression in normal colon tissue are likely overwhelmed by inter-individual variability in microarray analyses. Differential expression of critical genes between colonic epithelium and stroma suggest that these tissue types need to be considered separately.
"AIM" To evaluate the influence of taking low-dose aspirin for 4 wk on small intestinal complications and to examine the preventive effect of rebamipide.METHODS:  This study was conducted as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study. Eleven healthy male subjects were enrolled. Each subject underwent video capsule endoscopy after 1 and 4 wk of taking aspirin and omeprazole, along with either rebamipide or placebo therapy. The primary endpoint was to evaluate small bowel damage in healthy subjects before and after taking low-dose aspirin for 4 wk.RESULTS:  The number of subjects with mucosal breaks (defined as multiple erosions and/or ulcers) were 1 at 1 wk and 1 at 4 wk on the jejunum, and 6 at 1 wk (P = 0.0061) and 7 at 4 wk on the ileum (P = 0.0019). Rebamipide significantly prevented mucosal breaks on the ileum compared with the placebo group (P = 0.0173 at 1 wk and P = 0.0266 at 4 wk).: "" Longer-term, low-dose aspirin administration induced damage in the small bowel. Rebamipide prevented this damage, and may be a candidate drug for treating aspirin-induced small bowel complications.
 Clinical trials measuring the effect of an intervention on clinical outcomes are more influential than those investigating surrogate measures but are costly. We developed methods to reduce costs substantially by using existing data in primary care systems, to ask whether Helicobacter pylori eradication would reduce the incidence of hospitalisation for ulcer bleeding in aspirin users.METHODS:  The Helicobacter Eradication Aspirin Trial (HEAT) is a National Institute of Health Research-funded, double-blind placebo controlled randomised trial of the effects of H. pylori eradication on subsequent ulcer bleeding in infected individuals taking aspirin daily, conducted in practices across the whole of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A bespoke web-based trial management system developed for the trial (and housed within the secure NHS Data Network) communicates directly with the HEAT Toolkit software downloaded at participating practices, which issues queries searching entry criteria (≥ 60 years, on chronic aspirin ≤ 325 mg daily, not on anti-ulcer therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for GP review of eligibility. Trial participation is invited using a highly secure automated online mail management system. Interested patients are seen once for consent and breath testing. Those with a positive test are randomised to eradication treatment (lansoprazole, clarithromycin, metronidazole) or placebo, with drug sent by post. Events are tracked by upload of accumulating information in the GP database, patient contact, review of National Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics data.RESULTS:  HEAT is the largest Clinical Research Network-supported drug trial, with 115,660 invitation letters sent from 850 practices, 22,922 volunteers, and 3038 H. pylori positive patients randomised to active or placebo treatment after 2.5 years of recruitment. 178 practices have performed their first follow-up data search to identify 21 potential endpoints to date.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" HEAT is important medically, because aspirin is so widely used, and methodologically, as a successful trial would show that large-scale studies of important clinical outcomes can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of those conducted by industry, which in turn will help to ensure that trials of primarily medical rather than commercial interest can be conducted successfully in the UK.
 Although a challenge test using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is crucial for diagnosis of aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), it also has drawbacks in terms of possible side effects. Therefore, alternative in-vitro diagnostic methods for AIA are awaited.METHODS:  Nineteen stable non-AIA patients (9 males and 10 females; mean age, 49.4 ± 4.8 years), and 20 AIA patients (9 males and 11 females; mean age, 51.1 ± 4.8 years) were enrolled in this study. CD11b and CD16 expressions on the peripheral-blood granulocytes after administration of aspirin and different concentrations of PGE2 in vitro were examined using flowcytometry.RESULTS:  Aspirin induced a significant increase in CD11b expression on eosinophils (CD16 negative granulocytes) in 19 AIA patients and one non-AIA patient. Increase in CD11b expression on eosinophils by aspirin administration was suppressed by PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner.S:  The measurement of CD11b expression on peripheral-blood eosinophils showed very high sensitivity and specificity of (-95%) in diagnosing AIA. Although this method requires laboratory facilities for flowcytometry, it may be very useful in diagnosis of AIA without side effects. In addition, PGE2 may be involved in regulation of CD11b expression on eosinophils by aspirin administration.
 Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a clinical triad consisting of aspirin/acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) sensitivity, bronchial asthma, and nasal polyposis. Although respiratory reactions following ingestion of ASA and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered a hallmark of the condition, respiratory inflammation persists despite patients' avoidance of NSAIDs. Treatment of this condition remains challenging and includes both medical and surgical options.METHODS:  A prospective crossover single-blind multicenter study involving 4 tertiary rhinology care centers (n = 30) was conducted in which patients were randomized to start with either 6 weeks of a regular diet or 6 weeks of a low-salicylate diet and then crossed-over for a total study duration of 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks (at crossover) and 12 weeks using subjective measures (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 [SNOT-22], Nasal Sinus Symptom Scale [NSSS], and 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ-7]) and objective outcome instruments (Perioperative Sinus Evaluation [POSE] and Lund-Kennedy Endoscopic Score [LKES]).RESULTS:  Data was analyzed for 30 patients. Wilcoxon rank sum tests determined that patients had improvement in their median difference in scores, which were all statistically significant, when they followed the low-salicylate diet compared to their regular diet: SNOT-22: 15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10 to 23.25), p < 0.001; NSSS: 3 (95% CI, 1.75 to 4), p < 0.001; ACQ-7: 4.5 (95% CI, 1.5 to 8.5), p < 0.001; POSE 6 (95% CI, 2.5 to 10), p < 0.001; and LKES: 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4), p < 0.001).: "" The low-salicylate diet may offer a novel treatment adjunct to the current management of AERD. Clinically and statistically significant improvements on both subjective and objective outcome measures were noted for the upper and lower respiratory tracts.
 For patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary bypass surgery, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) currently represents the gold standard of antiplatelet treatment. However, adverse cardiovascular event rates in the first year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) still exceed 10%. Graft failure, which is predominantly mediated by platelet aggregation, has been identified as a major contributing factor in this context. Therefore, intensified platelet inhibition is likely to be beneficial. Ticagrelor, an oral, reversibly binding and direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist, provides a rapid, competent, and consistent platelet inhibition and has shown beneficial results compared with clopidogrel in the subset of patients undergoing bypass surgery in a large previous trial.HYPOTHESIS: "HYPOTHESIS" Ticagrelor is superior to ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events within 1 year after CABG.STUDY DESIGN: The TiCAB trial (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01755520" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT01755520</a) is a multicenter, phase III, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial comparing ticagrelor with ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events within 12 months after CABG. Patients undergoing CABG will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or ASA 100 mg once daily. The study medication will be started within 24 hours after surgery and maintained for 12 months. The primary end point is the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization at 12 months after CABG. The sample size is based on an expected event rate of 13% of the primary end point within the first 12 months after randomization in the control group, a 2-sided α level of .0492 (to preserve the overall significance level of .05 after planned interim analysis), a power of 0.80%, 2-sided testing, and an expected relative risk of 0.775 in the active group compared with the control group and a dropout rate of 2%. According to power calculations based on a superiority design for ticagrelor, it is estimated that 3,850 patients should be enrolled.SUMMARY: "SUMMARY" There is clinical equipoise on the issue of optimal platelet inhibition after CABG. The TiCAB trial will provide a pivotal comparison of the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor compared with ASA after CABG.
The present study evaluated the bioavailability and bioequivalence of fixed dose combination test formulation (atorvastatin 10 mg and aspirin 150 mg capsule) against marketed reference formulations (Lipitor® tablets 10 mg and Nu-Seals tablets 75 mg). This study was an open label, balanced, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, single dose, crossover trial in 80 healthy adult human volunteers under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, aspirin and salicylic acid were quantified using LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental model and mean pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between test and reference formulations. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Cmax /AUC0-t and Cmax/AUC0-∞) for atorvastatin test and reference formulations were (52.69 ng.h/mL, 55.64 ng.h/mL, 9.45 ng/mL, 0.18 1/h and 0.17 1/h) and (52.20 ng.h/mL, 55.38 ng.h/mL, 10.25 ng/mL, 0.20 1/h and 0.19 1/h) respectively; and for aspirin were (1 378.62 ng.h/mL, 1 383.90 ng.h/mL, 1 022.18 ng/mL, 0.75 1/h and 0.75 1/h) and (1 314.17 ng.h/mL, 1 314.50 ng.h/mL, 985.90 ng/mL, 0.75 1/h and 0.75 1/h) respectively. Where as for salicylic acid, above parameters were (42 357.57 ng.h/mL, 44 139.47 ng.h/mL, 9 820.15 ng/mL, 0.24 1/h and 0.23 1/h) and (40 217.08 ng.h/mL, 42 032.44 ng.h/mL, 9 569.18 ng/mL, 0.24 1/h and 0.24 1/h) respectively for test and reference formulations. The 90% confidence intervals of atorvastatin and salicylic acid for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Cmax /AUC0-t and Cmax/AUC0-∞ parameters were found to be within the acceptable regulatory bioequivalence limits. In conclusion, the new fixed dose combination test formulation was bioequivalent to the reference formulations under fasting conditions.
 The PeriOperative ISchemia Evaluation-2 (POISE-2) trial compared aspirin with placebo after noncardiac surgery.METHODS:  The authors randomly assigned 10,010 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery to receive 200 mg aspirin or placebo 2 to 4 h before surgery and then 100 mg aspirin daily or placebo daily for up to 30 days after surgery. Herein, the authors report the effect of aspirin on venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, as well as an updated pooled analysis of randomized trials of antiplatelet therapy for VTE prevention in noncardiac surgery patients.RESULTS:  Six thousand five hundred forty-eight patients (65.4%) received anticoagulant prophylaxis. VTE occurred in 53 patients (1.1%) allocated to aspirin and in 60 patients (1.2%) allocated to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.28). Major or life-threatening bleeding occurred in 312 patients (6.3%) allocated to aspirin and in 256 patients (5.1%) allocated to placebo (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.44). Concomitant use of anticoagulant prophylaxis did not modify the effect of aspirin on VTE or bleeding. Pooled analysis of the POISE-2 and Pulmonary Embolism Prevention trials demonstrated that symptomatic VTE occurred in 173 (1.3%) of 13,724 patients allocated to aspirin and in 246 (1.8%) of 13,730 patients allocated to placebo (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.89; heterogeneity P = 0.27; I = 17%); the impact of aspirin was very similar in those who did and did not receive pharmacologic prophylaxis. Pooled estimates for symptomatic VTE were similar to the pooled estimates for any deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism from the POISE-2 trial, Pulmonary Embolism Prevention trial, and the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis.S:  Aspirin in the POISE-2 trial did not reduce VTE, but two thirds of patients received anticoagulant prophylaxis, there were few VTE events, and results were consistent with a wide range of aspirin effects. A pooled analysis of the randomized trials demonstrates evidence for the efficacy of aspirin for VTE prevention in hospitalized surgical patients.
 To evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin in prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in women with second trimester alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >2.5 multiple of median (MOM) and to compare aspirin effect on women with normal and abnormal uterine artery (UtA) Doppler. The primary outcome was the adverse pregnancy outcome.METHODS:  This randomized controlled trial was conducted in singleton pregnant women, who had unexplained AFP >2.5 MOM and gestational age between 15 and 18 weeks of gestation. They were assigned randomly to receive either aspirin (N = 65) or control (N = 68). UtA Doppler velocimetry studies were performed at the time of targeted ultrasonographic exam.RESULTS:  Two groups were comparable regarding the maternal characteristics. The frequency of APO in aspirin and control groups were 26.1% versus 44.1% (p = 0.045), the frequency of preterm delivery before 34 weeks were 3.2% versus 22.0% in aspirin and control group, p = 0.001. Other outcomes were similar in both groups. The frequency of adverse outcomes in women with abnormal UtA Doppler was 39.1% in aspirin and 60.0% in control group, p = 0.556.: "" Low-dose aspirin reduces APO and delivery before 34 weeks of gestation in pregnant women with unexplained elevated AFP.
"BACKGROUND/AIMS" To compare the endoscopic features of LDA-induced ulcers developing during secondary prophylaxis with lansoprazole (LPZ) and gefarnate (GFN).METHODOLOGY: "METHODOLOGY" All ulcers that had developed during prophylaxis with LPZ (15mg once daily) and GFN (50mg twice daily) in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, were reviewed and compared by a panel of expert endoscopists, based on endoscopic images available from the trial, to provide evidence for efficacy of LPZ versus GFN in secondary prophylaxis in patients with endoscopically confirmed ulcer scars.RESULTS:  A total of 6 and 53 patients had developed gastric or duodenal ulcers during prophylaxis with LPZ and GFN, respectively. Six gastric ulcers seen in those given LPZ were "small" and "shallow", while, of the 38 gastric ulcers seen those given GFN, 44.7% and 55.3% were "medium" or "large" and "small", respectively. Ulcers associated with blood coagula were seen only in those given GFN. Duodenal ulcers developed in 15 and 0 patients given GFN and LPZ, respectively.S:  The ulcers developing during prophylaxis with GFN and LPZ varied in their features. The study findings may be useful when devising a strategy for prophylaxis of ulcers in high-risk patients receiving LDA therapy in a routine clinical setting.
"AIM" A recent clinical trial showed the preventive effect of cilostazol on cerebrovascular diseases. We compared the effects of cilostazol with aspirin on circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a surrogate marker for cardiovascular disease, and lipid metabolism in a randomized controlled trial (UMIN000000537).METHODS:  Forty-nine diabetic outpatients with leukoaraiosis or asymptomatic old cerebral infarction were enrolled in the study with written informed consent. They were randomly assigned to a cilostazol (200 mg daily, n= 24) or aspirin group (100 mg daily, n= 25), and followed for 16 weeks. Changes in circulating CD34(+) CD45(low) CD133(+) VEGFR2(+) EPCs (ΔEPC) were a primary endpoint. Changes in CD34(+) CD45(low) CD133(+) progenitor cells (ΔPC), p-selectin-positive platelet, platelet-monocyte binding measured by flow cytometry, LDL-, HDL-, small dense LDL (sdLDL)-cholesterol and triacylglycerol were the secondary endpoints.RESULTS:  Twenty patients in each group completed the study. ΔEPC were significantly higher in the cilostazol group than aspirin group at 16 weeks, while ΔPC were already significantly higher at 4 weeks in the cilostazol group. Changes in p-selectin-positive platelets and platelet-monocyte binding were similar in both groups. The cilostazol group showed significantly less sdLDL- and higher HDL-cholesterol than the aspirin group at both 4 and 16 weeks. ΔEPC were significantly and inversely correlated with changes of sdLDL, while positively with those of HDL. Analysis of covariance showed that a significant relation of ΔEPCs with cilostazol treatment was confounded by changes in HDL- and sdLDL-cholesterol.: "" Cilostazol increases circulating EPCs and decreases small-dense LDL in diabetic patients with cerebral ischemia.
 Early-onset hypertensive disorders (HD) of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age infants (SGA) are associated with placental vascular thrombosis, these often recur and are also associated with inheritable thrombophilia. Aspirin reduces the recurrence risk.S: "S" Adding low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to aspirin at < 12 weeks gestation reduces the recurrence of HD in women with previous early-onset HD (pre-eclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets [HELLP] syndrome and eclampsia) and/or SGA, in the context of inheritable thrombophilia without antiphospholipid antibodies.PATIENTS/METHODS: "PATIENTS/METHODS" In a multicenter randomized control trial (RCT), 139 women included were< 12 weeks gestation.INCLUSION CRITERIA: "INCLUSION CRITERIA" previous delivery< 34 weeks gestation with HD and/or SGA; inheritable thrombophilia (protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden heterozygosity and prothrombin gene G20210A mutation heterozygosity); and no antiphospholipid antibodies detected.INTERVENTION: "INTERVENTION" either daily LMWH (dalteparin, 5000 IU weight-adjusted dosage) with aspirin 80 mg or aspirin 80 mg alone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" PRIMARY OUTCOMES: "PRIMARY OUTCOMES" recurrent HD onset (i) < 34 weeks gestation and (ii) irrespective of gestational age.SECONDARY OUTCOMES: "SECONDARY OUTCOMES" recurrent SGA, preterm birth, maternal/neonatal hospitalization, spontaneous abortion and individual HD. Analysis by intention-to-treat.RESULTS:  Low-molecular-weight heparin with aspirin reduced recurrent HD onset < 34 weeks gestation (risk difference [RD] 8.7%: confidence interval [CI] of RD 1.9–15.5%; P = 0.012; number needed to treat [NNT] 12). Recurrent HD irrespective of gestational age was not different between the arms. No women withdrew as a result of adverse effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" http://www.isrctn.org) (isrctn87325378).S:  Adding LMWH to aspirin at < 12 weeks gestation reduces recurrent HD onset < 34 weeks gestation in women with inheritable thrombophilia and prior delivery for HD/SGA <34 weeks. However, close monitoring of the mother and fetus remains important throughout pregnancy.
 Platelet aggregation is enhanced in firefighters following short bouts of work in thermal protective clothing (TPC). We sought to determine if aspirin therapy before and/or following exertion in TPC prevents platelet activation.METHODS:  In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 102 firefighters were randomized to receive daily therapy (81 mg aspirin or placebo) for 14 days before and a single dose (325 mg aspirin or placebo) following exercise in TPC resulting in four potential assignments: aspirin before and after exercise (AA), placebo before and after exercise (PP), aspirin before and placebo after exercise (AP), and placebo before and aspirin after exercise (PA). Platelet closure time (PCT) was measured with a platelet function analyzer before the 2-week treatment, after the 2 week treatment period, immediately after exercise, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes later.RESULTS:  Baseline PCT did not differ between groups. PCT changed over time in all four groups (p < 0.001) rising to a median of >300 seconds [IQR 99, 300] in AA and >300 [92, 300] in AP prior to exercise. Following exercise, median PCT decreased to in all groups. Median PCT returned to >300 seconds 30 minutes later in AA and AP and rose to 300 seconds in PA 60 minutes after exercise.S:  Daily aspirin therapy blunts platelet activation during exertional heat stress and single-dose aspirin therapy following exertional heat stress reduces platelet activation within 60 minutes.
"S" This study sought to examine the relationship between the aspirin dose prescribed at hospital discharge and long-term outcomes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).BACKGROUND:  Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who undergo primary PCI are prescribed maintenance aspirin doses that vary between 75 and 325 mg daily. Whether the dose of aspirin affects long-term patient outcomes is unknown.METHODS:  We compared 3-year outcomes in patients who were prescribed high-dose (>200 mg daily) versus low-dose (≤200 mg daily) aspirin from the large-scale HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial.RESULTS:  Among 2,851 patients, 2,289 patients (80.3%) were discharged on low-dose aspirin and 562 patients (19.7%) were discharged on high-dose aspirin. Patients discharged on high-dose rather than low-dose aspirin were more likely to have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of premature coronary disease, prior treatment with PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery, and to be enrolled in the United States. Patients discharged on high-dose aspirin had higher 3-year rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, reinfarction, ischemic target vessel revascularization, major bleeding, and stent thrombosis. After multivariable analysis, discharge on high-dose aspirin was an independent predictor of major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.31 to 5.99; p = 0.008), but not of adverse ischemic events.S:  In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI, discharge on high-dose rather than low-dose aspirin may increase the rate of major bleeding without providing additional ischemic benefit.
 Aspirin-related peptic ulcers are a common disorder. However, whether or not aspirin should be continued during treatment for aspirin-related ulcers remains unclear.AIMS: "AIMS" To compare esomeprazole alone with esomeprazole plus aspirin in the treatment of aspirin-related peptic ulcers and to investigate the independent factors associated with the failure of ulcer healing.METHODS:  From January 2008 to July 2011, patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers were randomized to receive esomeprazole (40 mg per day) alone or esomeprazole (40 mg per day) plus aspirin (100 mg per day) for 8 weeks. The subjects with Helicobacter pylori infection were treated with standard triple therapy. Follow-up endoscopy was carried out at the end of the 8th week. The primary end point was the healing of peptic ulcers.RESULTS:  In all, 178 patients (89 receiving esomeprazole alone and 89 receiving esomeprazole plus aspirin) were enrolled and underwent follow-up endoscopy. The healing rate of ulcers by modified intention-to-treat analysis was 82.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2-90.8%) among patients treated with esomeprazole alone and 81.5% (95% CI, 73.0-90.0%) among patients treated with esomeprazole plus aspirin (difference, 1.0%; 95% CI, -11.2 to 12.6%). The per-protocol analysis yielded similar results (healing rate: 83.1% vs. 83.8%, respectively; difference, 0.7%; 95% CI, -11.2 to 12.6%). Multivariate analysis disclosed that use of steroids during treatment (odds ratio: 5.6; 95% CI, 1.1-27.7%) was the only independent factor associated with the failure of ulcer healing.S:  The observed ulcer healing rates were comparable in the esomeprazole and esomeprazole-plus-aspirin groups, but the wide CIs do not rule out clinically meaningful differences of more than 10%.
"" Early initiation of low-dose aspirin (LDA) may reduce preeclampsia risk. We sought to determine whether LDA was beneficial when initiated <17w0d, within a trial of high-risk women enrolled <26w0d.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" Secondary analysis of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units High-Risk Aspirin study, including women enrolled <17w0d, randomized to LDA (60 mg day(-1)) or placebo with chronic hypertension (CHTN, n=186), diabetes (n=191) or prior preeclampsia (n=146). The primary outcome was preeclampsia at any time in pregnancy, secondary outcomes were early preeclampsia (<34w0d), late preeclampsia (⩾34w), small for gestational age (SGA; neonatal birthweight <10th %) and composite (early preeclampsia or SGA). Outcomes were compared by exact Χ(2)-tests.RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Aspirin was associated with a lower rate of late-onset preeclampsia ⩾34w (17.36% vs 24.42%, P=0.047), with a 41% reduction in women with CHTN (18.28% vs 31.18%, P=0.041). There were no other significant differences in the outcome.: "" Aspirin initiated <17w0d reduced the risk for late-onset preeclampsia by 29% supporting the practice of early initiation of aspirin in high-risk women.
"INTRODUCTION" Aspirin (ASA) irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) leading to decreased thromboxane-mediated platelet activation. The effect of ASA ingestion on platelet activation, thromboxane generation, oxidative stress and anti-oxidant biomarkers was studied in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).MATERIAL AND METHODS: "MATERIAL AND METHODS" Baseline and post-ASA samples (100/325 mg x 7 days) were obtained from 75 DM patients and 86 healthy controls for urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (11 dhTxB2), 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2α (8-isoPGF2α) and serum sP-Selectin, nitrite (NO(2)(-)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity.RESULTS:  Compared to baseline controls, baseline DM had higher mean levels of 11 dhTxB2 (3,665 ± 2,465 vs 2,450 ± 1,572 pg/mg creatinine, p=0.002), 8-isoPGF2α (1,457 ± 543 vs 1,009 ± 412 pg/mg creatinine, p<0.0001), NO(2)(-) (11.8 ± 7.3 vs 4.8 ± 5.3 μM, p<0.0001), NO(3)(-) (50.4 ± 39.3 vs 20.9 ± 16.7 μM, p<0.0001) and sP-Selectin (120.8 ± 56.7 vs 93.0 ± 26.1 ng/mL, p=0.02), and the same held for post-ASA levels (p<0.0001). ASA demonstrated no effect on 8-isoPGF2α, NO(2)(-), NO(3)(-), sP-Selectin or PON1 activity in either DM or controls. Post ASA inhibition of urinary 11 dhTxB2 was 71.5% in DM and 75.1% in controls. There were twice as many ASA poor responders in DM than in controls (14.8% and 8.4%) based on systemic thromboxane reduction. Urinary 8-isoPGF2α excretion was greater in DM ASA poor responders than good responders (p<0.009).S:  This suggests that oxidative stress may maintain platelet function irrespective of COX-1 pathway inhibition and/or increase systemic generation of thromboxane from non-platelet sources.
 It is unknown whether warfarin or aspirin therapy is superior for patients with heart failure who are in sinus rhythm.METHODS:  We designed this trial to determine whether warfarin (with a target international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.5) or aspirin (at a dose of 325 mg per day) is a better treatment for patients in sinus rhythm who have a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We followed 2305 patients for up to 6 years (mean [±SD], 3.5±1.8). The primary outcome was the time to the first event in a composite end point of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or death from any cause.RESULTS:  The rates of the primary outcome were 7.47 events per 100 patient-years in the warfarin group and 7.93 in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with warfarin, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.10; P=0.40). Thus, there was no significant overall difference between the two treatments. In a time-varying analysis, the hazard ratio changed over time, slightly favoring warfarin over aspirin by the fourth year of follow-up, but this finding was only marginally significant (P=0.046). Warfarin, as compared with aspirin, was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke throughout the follow-up period (0.72 events per 100 patient-years vs. 1.36 per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.82; P=0.005). The rate of major hemorrhage was 1.78 events per 100 patient-years in the warfarin group as compared with 0.87 in the aspirin group (P<0.001). The rates of intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups (0.27 events per 100 patient-years with warfarin and 0.22 with aspirin, P=0.82).
"" To determine the maternal and neonatal efficacy and safety with furosemide, amlodipine or aspirin in women with mild/moderate chronic hypertension during pregnancy.METHODS:  A pilot clinical trial was performed in a tertiary teaching hospital in Panama. Pregnant patients with mild/moderate chronic hypertension at ≤20 weeks of gestation were invited to take part in the study. Mild/moderate chronic hypertension was defined as a pregnancy with systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 90-109 mmHg. Women in the furosemide group received 20 mg of furosemide oral each day, those in the amlodipine group received 5 mg of amlodipine oral each day and those in the aspirin group received 75 mg of orally-administered acetylsalicylic acid each day.RESULTS:  We enrolled 63 patients during the study period, 21 women were randomised to each group (aspirin, amlodipine and furosemide). We found no difference in maternal complications, pre-term births, mean birth weight or in the proportion of small for gestational age infants among treatment groups. Severe hypertension and aggregate pre-eclampsia were similar among treatment groups.: "" This pilot trial demonstrates that both furosemide and amlodipine might have the same effect during pregnancy. However, a large clinical trial is necessary to prove this.
A new formulation of a micronized acetylsalicylic acid swallowable tablet with an effervescent component (FR-aspirin) was evaluated in two independent studies using the dental impaction pain model. These clinical studies were performed to confirm the results of preclinical dissolution studies and human pharmacokinetic studies, which indicated an improved onset of analgesia without compromising duration of effect or safety. Study 1 evaluated a 650-mg dose of aspirin and Study 2 evaluated a 1,000-mg dose of aspirin. Both studies were double-blinded, parallel group and compared to regular aspirin (R-aspirin) and placebo. Speed of onset was measured by the double stopwatch method for time to both first perceptible relief and meaningful relief. In both studies, the FR-aspirin was significantly faster (p<0.038-0.001) than both R-aspirin and placebo for both onset measures. There were no significant differences between FR-aspirin and R-aspirin for peak or total effects and both treatments were significantly better than placebo. For first perceptible relief, FR-aspirin onset was 19.8 and 16.3 min for 650 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively, compared to 23.7 and 20.0 for R-aspirin. For meaningful relief, FR-aspirin onset was 48.9 and 49.4 min for 650 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively, compared to 119.2 and 99.2 for R-aspirin. These efficacy studies clearly demonstrate that the onset of analgesic efficacy is dramatically improved by adding an effervescent component and micronized active ingredient to the swallowable tablet aspirin formulation. The enhanced onset did not adversely impact either the peak effect or duration of effect or tolerability compared to regular aspirin.
 The currently recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in drug-eluting stent (DES) recipients is 12 months to reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis, particularly in those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).S: "S" This study hypothesized that antiplatelet treatment with DAPT for 6 months may be noninferior to 24-month DAPT in aspirin-sensitive patients.METHODS:  A multicenter, randomized study assigned patients undergoing implantation of everolimus-eluting stents with confirmed nonresistance to aspirin to receive 6- or 24-month DAPT. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding at 12 months post-stenting.RESULTS:  A total of 2,031 patients were enrolled in 70 European and Middle Eastern centers. The trial was prematurely terminated due to recruitment problems, leaving 941 patients randomized to 24-month DAPT and 953 to 6-month DAPT. The 2 treatment groups had similar baseline and procedural characteristics. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (24-month: 1.5% vs. 6-month: 1.6%; p = 0.85). Noninferiority was demonstrated for 6- versus 24-month DAPT, with an absolute risk difference of 0.11% (95% confidence interval: -1.04% to 1.26%; p for noninferiority = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in stent thrombosis or bleeding complications. In the 792 (44%) high-risk patients with ACS, primary and secondary endpoints did not significantly differ (hazard ratio: 1.7 [95% confidence interval: 0.519 to 6.057; p = 0.361]).
 The TAXUS Liberté Post Approval Study (TL-PAS) contributed patients treated with TAXUS Liberté paclitaxel-eluting stent and prasugrel to the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study (DAPT) that compared 12 and 30 months thienopyridine plus aspirin therapy after drug-eluting stents.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" Outcomes for 2191 TL-PAS patients enrolled into DAPT were assessed. The DAPT coprimary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction [MI], or stroke) was lower with 30 compared with 12 months prasugrel treatment (3.7% versus 8.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.407; P<0.001). Rates of death and stroke were similar between groups, but MI was significantly reduced with prolonged prasugrel treatment (1.9% versus 7.1%; HR, 0.255; P<0.001). The DAPT coprimary end point, stent thrombosis, was also lower with longer therapy (0.2% versus 2.9%; HR, 0.063; P<0.001). MI related to stent thrombosis (0% versus 2.6%; P<0.001) and occurring spontaneously (1.9% versus 4.5%; HR, 0.407; P=0.007) were both reduced with prolonged prasugrel. MI rates increased within 90 days of prasugrel cessation after both 12 and 30 months treatment. Composite Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) moderate or severe bleeds were modestly increased (2.4% versus 1.7%; HR, 1.438; P=0.234) but severe bleeds were not more frequent (0.3% versus 0.5%; HR, 0.549; P=0.471) in the prolonged treatment group.S:  Prasugrel and aspirin continued for 30 months reduced ischemic events for the TAXUS Liberté paclitaxel-eluting stent patient subset from DAPT through reductions in MI and stent thrombosis. Withdrawal of prasugrel was followed by an increase in MI after both 12 and 30 months therapy. The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy with prasugrel after TAXUS Liberté paclitaxel-eluting stent remains unknown, but appears to be >30 months.
"" Patients with type 1 diabetes form a less permeable fibrin network, which could contribute to their increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-dose aspirin treatment is the standard in the management of CVD; however, the effect seems reduced in patients with diabetes. We investigated the effects of low- and high-dose aspirin treatment on fibrin network formation in patients with type 1 diabetes (primary aim) and the possible interaction between the treatment effects of aspirin on fibrin network permeability and glycemic control in these patients (secondary aim).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS" Forty-eight patients (24 subjects with good [HbA(1c) <7.4%] and 24 subjects with poor [HbA(1c) >8.4%] glycemic control) were randomly assigned to treatment with 75 or 320 mg/day aspirin during 4 weeks in a crossover fashion. A 4-week washout period separated the treatment periods. The plasma fibrin network was assessed by determination of the permeability coefficient (K(s)).RESULTS:  Treatment with 75 mg aspirin did not influence fibrin network permeability (K(s)). However, K(s) increased significantly during treatment with 320 mg aspirin (P = 0.004), and a significant treatment effect was seen compared with treatment with 75 mg aspirin (P = 0.009). The increase in K(s) during high-dose aspirin treatment was significant in patients with poor glycemic control (P = 0.02), whereas K(s) only tended to increase in patients with good glycemic control (P = 0.06).S:  A high dose of aspirin is required to influence fibrin network permeability in patients with type 1 diabetes. The observed lack of effect with low-dose aspirin may contribute to aspirin treatment failure in diabetes.
"S" Current guidelines for the treatment of patients with obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) recommend low dose aspirin (LDA) and prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Most clinicians use a fixed dosage of LMWH in pregnant APS women despite the fact that there are no clinical trials establishing that fixed doses are more efficacious than adjusted ones in preventing pregnancy complications. The efficacy and safety of adjusted single daily doses of LMWH (nadroparin) combined with LDA have thus been evaluated in 33 consecutive pregnancies in women with diagnosed obstetric APS.METHODS:  LMWH doses were augmented as the pregnancies progressed and maternal/foetal weight increased. 70-80-90 U/Kg doses ranging between 3800 and 6650 U were administered daily during the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. LDA (100 mg/day) was also prescribed.RESULTS:  Pregnancy outcome was successful in 97% of the patients studied, who delivered, between the 29th and 41st weeks of gestation (mean 37.4 ±2.1 SD), 32 infants with a mean birth weight of 3084 g ± 514 SD. One woman (3%) experienced a spontaneous abortion at the 8th week of gestation.S:  The high live birth rate, the satisfactory mean gestational age and weight at birth and the absence of major pregnancy/neonatal-associated complications indicate that adjusted, once daily doses of LMWH together with LDA could be an efficacious treatment option for pregnant APS patients with no history of thrombosis.
"INTRODUCTION" Kidney disease predisposes to cardiovascular events. This study investigated the influence of renal function and platelet turnover on the antiplatelet effect of aspirin in patients with coronary artery disease.: "" We included 124 aspirin-treated patients with coronary artery disease and normal to moderately reduced renal function. All tests were performed one hour after aspirin ingestion. Renal function was assessed using creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and cystatin C. The antiplatelet effect of aspirin was evaluated using the VerifyNow Aspirin assay and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate) induced by collagen (1.0 μg/mL) and arachidonic acid (1.0 mmol/L). Von Willebrand factor was measured as a marker of endothelial dysfunction. Platelet turnover was evaluated by measurements of immature, reticulated platelets.RESULTS:  Renal function did not influence the antiplatelet effect of aspirin evaluated by MEA (r=-0.2-0.09, p=0.03-0.77) or the VerifyNow (r=-0.12-0.11, all p-values>0.1). In contrast, renal function correlated inversely with von Willebrand factor levels (r(creatinine)=0.48, p<0.0001; r(eGFR)=-0.46, p<0.001; r(cystatin C)=0.54, p<0.0001). The number of immature platelets correlated with platelet aggregation according to MEA (r=0.20-0.39, all p-values<0.03), but not according to VerifyNow (r=-0.07, p=0.50).S:  A reduced antiplatelet effect of aspirin may be explained by an increased number of immature platelets. Moderately impaired renal function was associated with high levels of von Willebrand factor, but not with a reduced antiplatelet effect of aspirin.
"AIMS" To evaluate the effects of treatments with clopidogrel plus aspirin (dual therapy) on early neurological deterioration (END) and outcomes at 6 months in patients with acute large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke.METHODS:  A total of 574 patients with LAA stroke were randomly assigned to receive either dual therapy or aspirin alone (monotherapy). The primary outcome was END. Secondary outcomes included recurrent ischemic stroke (RIS) and outcomes at 6 months.RESULTS:  The prevalence of END and RIS was lower in patients on dual therapy than in those on monotherapy during the 30 days. At 6 months, dual therapy improved outcomes among older patients and those with symptomatic stenosis in the posterior circulation and basilar artery.: "" Clopidogrel plus aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for reducing END and RIS within 30 days and improves outcomes in certain subgroups at 6 months.
 Mild hypothermia (34-35 °C) increases perioperative blood loss. Our previous studies showed that desmopressin could have in vitro beneficial effects on hypothermia-induced primary haemostasis impairment. In this study, we investigate the in vitro effects of desmopressin on hypothermia-induced primary haemostasis impairment under the influence of aspirin in healthy volunteers.METHODS:  Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to taking aspirin 100 mg or placebo for three days. On the sixth day blood samples were taken before and after the injection of desmopressin (1.5 microgram or 5 microgram) or normal saline subcutaneously. Measurements including Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100®) closure times, plasma von Willebrand Factor antigen, haemoglobin and platelet levels were made at 32 °C and 37 °C respectively.RESULTS:  Collagen/epinephrine closure time (EPICT) was significantly prolonged by 21.13 % (95 %CI 2.34-39.74 %, p = 0.021) in aspirin group at 37 °C. While hypothermia alone prolonged both collagen/adenosine diphosphate (ADPCT) and EPICT by 17.63 % (95 %CI 13.5-20.85 %, p < 0.001) and 8.0 % (95 %CI 6.38-10.04 %, p = 0.024) respectively, addition of aspirin only further prolonged EPICT by 19.9 % (95 %CI 3.32-36.49 %, p = 0.013). In aspirin group, desmopressin 1.5 microgram and 5 microgram significantly reduced ADPCT to below baseline levels at 37 °C (p = 0.025 and <0.001 respectively), whereas reduction in EPICT was seen with desmopressin 5 microgram (p =0.008). The effect was less pronounced at 32 °C, with a significant reduction in EPICT obtained with a dosage of 5 microgram only (p = 0.011).: "" It was shown that aspirin could further potentiate the hypothermia-induced closure time prolongations. Low dose desmopressin (1.5 microgram) reduced PFA-100® closure times towards baseline. A higher dosage (5 microgram) further reduced the closure times below baseline. Therefore low dose desmopressin (1.5 microgram) might have the potential to correct hypothermia-induced primary haemostasis impairment under the influence of aspirin during the perioperative period.
Capsaicin is a well-known component of red pepper. Recent studies have shown that capsaicin could prevent gastric ulcer provoked by various NSAID-s like acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Primary objective of this human clinical phase I trial was to investigate whether two different doses of capsaicin co-administered with ASA could alter the inhibitory effect of ASA on platelet aggregation. 15 healthy male subjects were involved in the study and treated orally with 400 μg capsaicin, 800 μg capsaicin, 500 mg ASA, 400 μg capsaicin+500 mg ASA and 800 μg capsaicin+500 mg ASA. Blood was drawn before and 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours after the drug administration. After that epinephrine induced platelet aggregation was measured by optical aggregometry. Between treatments, volunteers had a 6-day wash-out period. Our results showed that capsaicin had no effect on platelet aggregation, while as expected, ASA monotherapy resulted in a significant and clinically effective platelet aggregation inhibition (p ≤ 0.001). The combined ASA-capsaicin therapies reached equivalent effectiveness in platelet aggregation inhibition as ASA monotherapy. Our investigation proved that capsaicin did not influence the inhibitory effect of ASA on platelet aggregation, thus the capsaicin-ASA treatment would combine the antiplatelet effect of ASA with the possible gastroprotection of capsaicin. 
Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) but is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This prospective, open-label, randomized substudy of a phase 3 trial compared the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis with low-dose aspirin (ASA) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients with newly diagnosed MM, treated with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone induction and melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide consolidation. Overall, 342 patients who did not have clinical indications or contraindications to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy were randomly assigned to receive ASA 100 mg/d (n = 176) or LMWH enoxaparin 40 mg/d (n = 166). The incidence of VTE was 2.27% in the ASA group and 1.20% in the LMWH group. Compared with LMWH, the absolute difference in the proportion of VTE was 1.07% (95% confidence interval, -1.69-3.83; P = .452) in the ASA group. Pulmonary embolism was observed in 1.70% of patients in the ASA group and none in the LMWH group. No arterial thrombosis, acute cardiovascular events, or sudden deaths were reported. No major hemorrhagic complications were reported. In previously untreated patients with MM receiving lenalidomide with a low thromboembolic risk, ASA could be an effective and less-expensive alternative to LMWH thromboprophylaxis.
There are contradictory reports about the association of cytokines levels and major depressive disorder and the possible therapeutic role of aspirin for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). A clinical sample of adult out-patients with MDD was recruited. At recruitment, they were interviewed face to face according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. In addition, Hamilton depression rating scale was completed by a psychiatrist. The patients were invited to receive aspirin or placebo. All the 10 patients received 160mg/day aspirin plus citlaopram 20 mg/day. Eight out of ten patients showed severe anxiety and akathesia from early days of this trial. Except for two patients, we discontinued the medication during 14 days of this trial. Three patients were hospitalized due to anxiety and akathesia. Two patients reported suicidal behavior after the onset of this trial. This trial of aspirin adjuvant therapy for treating MDD suggests that this combination is not safe and there are some serious and intolerable adverse effects. This finding is in contrast to the suggestions assuming that aspirin may be effective for treating MDD. Aspirin may negatively impact on both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines balance in depression. Aspirin may antagonize the antidepressant effect of citalopram.
"INTRODUCTION" This study was designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of combined low dose aspirin and warfarin therapy following mechanical heart valve replacement.METHODS:  A total of 1496 patients (686 males, mean age 35±8.5 years) undergoing mechanical heart valvular replacement were randomly divided into study (warfarin plus 75-100 mg aspirin) or control (warfarin only) group. International normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time was maintained at 1.8-2.5 and 1.5-2.0 times of the normal value, respectively. Thromboembolic events and major bleedings were registered during follow up.RESULTS:  Patients were followed up for 24±9 months. The average dose of warfarin in the study and control group was 2.92±0.87 mg and 2.89±0.79 mg, respectively (p>0.05). The overall thromboembolic events in study group were lower than in control group (2.1% vs. 3.6%, p=0.044). No statistically significant differences were found in hemorrhage events (3.5% vs. 3.7%, p>0.05) or mortality (0.3% vs 0.4%, p>0.05) between the two groups.S:  Following mechanical valve replacement, combined low dose aspirin and warfarin therapy was associated with a greater reduction in thromboembolism events than warfarin therapy alone. This combined treatment was not associated with an increase in the rate of major bleeding or mortality.
 It is not clear what kind of drug is appropriate to heal NSAID-induced enteropathy. Several reports showed the preventive effect of prostaglandin analogue or inducer using healthy subjects who took NSAIDs. However there was no report for healing effect and for patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the healing effect of rebamipide in patients with NSAIDs-induced enteropathy. In addition, we evaluated for nutritional parameter.METHODS:  This study was conducted as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Study protocol was approved by each hospital's ethical committees. Patients with LDA and/or NSAID more than 3 months were enrolled. Patients with enteropathy were divided into the placebo and the rebamipide groups. Rebamipide 100 mg three times daily was administered during 4 weeks. Capsule endoscopies were performed at 0 and 4 week. The number of small intestinal ulcer and erosion were evaluated. Total protein was analyzed as nutritional parameter.RESULTS:  Sixty one participants were completed this study. Change in number of small intestinal erosion in the rebamipide group was -2.5 ± 3.4, and 2.1 ± 3.9 in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Change in number of small intestinal ulcer in the rebamipide group was -0.5 ± 1.6, and 0.1 ± 0.7 in the placebo group (P = 0.024). Change in serum total protein levels in the rebamipide group was 0.06 ± 0.36, and -0.27 ± 0.34 in the placebo group (P = 0.0005).S:  Rebamipide has not only the healing effect for NSAIDs-induced enteropathy compared with placebo, but the improvement of nutritional condition. These results showed a tentative therapeutical strategy for chronic NSAIDs users.
"AIMS" Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) for secondary prevention reduces cardiovascular disease mortality risk. ASA acetylates cyclooxygenase in the portal circulation and is rapidly (half-life, 20 min) hydrolyzed. Certain patients with cardiovascular disease may exhibit high on-therapy platelet reactivity as a result of high platelet turnover, a process whereby platelets are produced and are active beyond the duration of antiplatelet coverage provided by once-daily immediate-release (IR) ASA. A once-daily, extended-release (ER) ASA formulation using ER microcapsule technology was developed to release ASA over the 24-h dosing interval and reduce maximal plasma concentrations to spare peripheral endogenous endothelial prostacyclin production.METHODS:  Healthy adults (n = 50) were randomized in a crossover study to receive two different ER-ASA single doses (up to 325 mg) and two different IR-ASA single doses (up to 81 mg) in four periods, each separated by ≥14 days. Pharmacodynamics was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2), urine 11-dehydro-TXB2, and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. Pharmacokinetics was determined for ASA and salicylic acid (SA).RESULTS:  Both formulations produced dose-dependent inhibition on all pharmacodynamic parameters. Marked inhibition of TXB2 and 11-dehydro-TXB2 was maintained over the 24-h dosing interval after a dose of ≥81 mg ER-ASA or ≥40 mg IR-ASA. The dose required to achieve 50% of maximum TXB2 inhibition with ER-ASA was 49.9 mg versus 29.6 mg for IR-ASA, for a similar maximum pharmacodynamic effect (98.9% TXB2 inhibition). This suggests that an approximately twofold greater ER-ASA dose (162.5 mg) is necessary to obtain the same response as that of IR-ASA 81 mg. Peak ASA concentrations were lower and Tmax was longer with ER-ASA versus IR-ASA. Administration of IR-ASA resulted in a dose-normalized mean Cmax of ASA that was approximately sixfold higher than that for ER-ASA and a Cmax of SA approximately two- to threefold higher than that for ER-ASA.: "" Both ASA formulations showed dose-dependent antiplatelet activity. Compared with the IR-ASA, ER-ASA released active drug more slowly, resulting in prolonged absorption and lower systemic drug concentrations, which is expected for an ER (24-h) formulation.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" The Fraxiparin in Stroke Study for the treatment of ischemic stroke (FISS-tris) study showed no superiority of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over aspirin for the primary end point (Barthel Index) in acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusive disease. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of LMWH and aspirin in selected subgroups so as to generate hypotheses for further studies.METHODS:  The FISS-tris study was a multicenter, randomized trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of LMWH (nadroparin calcium 3800 antifactor Xa IU/0.4 mL subcutaneously twice daily) or aspirin (160 mg once daily) for the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke and large artery occlusive disease. The primary outcome was the Barthel Index score dichotomized at 85 6 months poststroke. Exploratory subgroup analysis was performed using different levels of baseline characteristics and the distribution of symptomatic arteries.RESULTS:  Compared with aspirin, LMWH improved outcome among older patients >68 years (P=0.043; OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.02-3.41) without ongoing antiplatelet treatment on admission (P=0.029; OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06-3.21) and with symptomatic posterior circulation arterial disease (P=0.001; OR, 5.76; 95% CI, 2.00-16.56).S:  Our findings suggest that LMWH may be of benefit in certain subgroups of patients with acute cerebral infarct and large artery occlusive disease. Hence, further investigation of LMWH may be justified in subgroups such as the elderly, nonusers of antiplatelet agents, and patients with posterior circulation stenosis.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: "CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION" URL: www.strokecenter.org/trials.

"" The objective of this parallel, double-blind, randomized pilot study was to determine the effect of a daily dose of 325 mg of aspirin (ASA) on the clinical outcomes of scaling and root planing in a selected group of adult smokers.BACKGROUND:  The response to periodontal therapy is inferior among smokers compared to non-smokers. Long-term intake of ASA has been shown to exert a positive impact on reducing both the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, among high-risk groups of subjects such as heavy smokers and diabetics. It is reasonable to assume that systemic administration of ASA in conjunction with reduction of the bacterial load by scaling and root planing may improve and prolong the benefits of periodontal therapy. To date, only few prospective interventional clinical studies have specifically addressed the periodontal needs of smokers.METHODS:  The study includes 24 smokers. The following clinical parameters were measured preoperatively and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 mo postoperatively: (i) gingival index; (ii) plaque index; (iii) probing depth; (iii) probing attachment level; (iv) gingival recession; and (v) bleeding scores. Study subjects received scaling and root planing over several visits and were randomly assigned into two equal groups; a control group (C), which received a placebo and a test group (T), which took a daily dose of 325 mg ASA. No additional therapy was provided over the 1 year observation period.RESULTS:  There were more statistically significant differences (p < 0.05; one- tailed) between pretest and posttest scores in the T group than in the C group. Mean percent increase in sites with probing depth 1-3 mm (T: 8.78; C: 7.21); mean percent reduction in sites with probing depth 4-6 mm (T: -7.25; C: -5.09 not statistically significant, NS); mean percent reduction in sites with probing depth ≥ 7 mm (T: -1.42; C: -02.09); mean percent reduction in sites with probing attachment level 3-4 mm (T: -3.63; C: 0.48 NS); mean percent reduction in sites with bleeding on probing (T: -12.37; C: -2.59 NS) (p < 0.05, NS).S:  Daily intake of 325 mg of ASA following scaling and root planing improved treatment outcomes in smokers, without an increase in gingival bleeding tendency. ASA promoted a higher incidence of shallow pockets and more gain in attachment level.
Reactions to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) are triggered when constraints upon activated eosinophils, normally supplied by PGE2, are removed secondary to cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition. However, the mechanism driving the concomitant cellular activation is unknown. We investigated the capacity of aspirin itself to provide this activation signal. Eosinophils were enriched from peripheral blood samples and activated with lysine ASA (LysASA). Parallel samples were stimulated with related nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Activation was evaluated as Ca2+ flux, secretion of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) release. CD34+ progenitor-derived mast cells were also used to test the influence of aspirin on human mast cells with measurements of Ca2+ flux and PGD2 release. LysASA induced Ca2+ fluxes and EDN release, but not CysLT secretion from circulating eosinophils. There was no difference in the sensitivity or extent of activation between AERD and control subjects, and sodium salicylate was without effect. Like eosinophils, aspirin was able to activate human mast cells directly through Ca2+ flux and PGD2 release. AERD is associated with eosinophils maturing locally in a high IFN-γ milieu. As such, in additional studies, eosinophil progenitors were differentiated in the presence of IFN-γ prior to activation with aspirin. Eosinophils matured in the presence of IFN-γ displayed robust secretion of both EDN and CysLTs. These studies identify aspirin as the trigger of eosinophil and mast cell activation in AERD, acting in synergy with its ability to release cells from the anti-inflammatory constraints of PGE2.
 The optimal medical strategy for prevention of thromboembolic events after surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (BAVR) is still debated. The objective of this study was to compare warfarin therapy (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) with aspirin 150mg daily as antithrombotic therapy for the first three months after BAVR with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim was to evaluate thromboembolic complications, major bleeding complications and death.: "" Prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial. 370 patients were enrolled, 328 were available for data analysis.RESULTS:  At baseline the warfarin and aspirin groups were comparable. Thromboembolic events were comparable between groups 11 (6.6%) vs. 12 (7.5%), p=0.83. Major bleeding events occurred numerically more often in warfarin patients 9 (5.4%) vs. 3 (1.9%), p=0.14. Warfarin was in multivariate analysis significantly associated with major bleeding OR 5.18 (CI 1.06-25.43), p=0.043. 90-day mortality was comparable between groups 8 (4.7%) vs. 6 (3.7%), p=0.79.S:  Our results suggest that aspirin might be equally effective as warfarin in preventing thromboembolic events after BAVR, but with less major bleedings. Although this is numerically the largest trial testing this hypothesis in a prospective randomized trial, further adequately powered studies are warranted.
 Migraine with aura (MA) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The role of aspirin on this association remains unclear.METHODS:  Post-hoc subgroup analyses of the Women's Health Study, a randomized trial testing 100 mg aspirin on alternate days in primary prevention of CVD among 39,876 women aged ≥ 45.RESULTS:  During 10 years, 998 major CVD events were confirmed in 39,757 women with complete migraine information. Aspirin reduced risk of ischaemic stroke (relative risk, RR, 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93) but not other CVD. Migraine or MA did not modify the effect of aspirin on CVD except for myocardial infarction (MI) (p for interaction = 0.01). Women with MA on aspirin had increased risk of MI (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.39-9.95). Further exploratory analyses indicate that this increased risk is only apparent among women with MA on aspirin who ever smoked or had history of hypertension (p for interaction<0.01).S:  In post-hoc subgroup analyses, aspirin had similar protective effects on ischaemic stroke for women with or without migraine. By contrast, our data suggest that women with MA on aspirin had increased risk of MI. The small number of outcome events in subgroups, the exploratory nature of our analyses, and lack of plausible mechanisms raise the possibility of a chance finding, which must caution the interpretation.
"INTRODUCTION" To investigate the prevalent of aspirin resistance (AR) in Chinese stroke patients and its association with recurrent stroke and other vascular events, including cardiovascular disease and death.METHODS:  We prospectively enrolled 634 Chinese stroke patients. Aspirin was administrated to every patient from the first day of admission. Whole blood samples were collected for platelet aggregation testing after aspirin was administered for 7-10 days. A follow-up period of 12-24 months was performed to record vascular events and hemorrhagic side effects.RESULTS:  Aspirin resistance (AR) was detected in 129 patients (20·4%), aspirin semi-resistance (ASR) in 28 patients (4·4%) and aspirin sensitivity (AS) in 477 patients (75·2%). Logistic regression analysis found that diabetes and high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) were independent risk factors for ASR and AR. During a median follow-up period of 19·4 months, the prevalence of recurrent stroke, death from all causes, myocardial infarction and vascular events overall were higher in patients with AR + ASR than in patients with AS. Cox regression analysis found that diabetes and AR were independent risk factors for vascular events.: "" Aspirin resistance is common in Chinese patient taking antiplatelet medications. Diabetes and high LDL may induce platelet activation and thrombosis and increase the occurrence of aspirin resistance. Patients who are detected to be aspirin resistant are at a greater risk of clinically important vascular events.
"AIMS" To test (1) whether a diabetes scorecard can improve glycaemic control, blood pressure control, LDL cholesterol, aspirin usage and exercise; (2) if the scorecard will motivate and/or educate patients to improve their scores for subsequent visits; and (3) whether the scorecard will improve rates of clinical inertia.METHODS:  Five physicians enrolled 103 patients ≥ 40 years old with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes [HbA(1c) ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%)] to randomly receive either a diabetes scorecard or not during four clinical visits over a 9-month period. The population was predominantly urban with a disproportionately higher percentage of black people than the general population. Our scorecard assigned points to six clinical variables, with a perfect total score of 100 points corresponding to meeting all targets. The primary outcomes were total scores and HbA(1c) in the scorecard and control groups at 9 months.RESULTS:  There were no significant differences between the control and scorecard groups at visits 1 and 4 in total score, HbA(1c) , blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, aspirin usage, exercise or knowledge about diabetic targets. By visit 4 both the control and scorecard groups had statistically significant improvements with their mean total score (9 and 7 points, respectively), HbA(1c) [-9 mmol/mol (-0.8%) and -15 mmol/mol (-1.4%), respectively] and aspirin usage (33% increase and 16% increase, respectively). Rates of clinical inertia were low throughout the study.S:  A diabetes scorecard did not improve glycaemic control, blood pressure control, LDL cholesterol, aspirin usage, exercise or diabetic knowledge in an urban population with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.
 The FAVOURED study is an international multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which commenced recruitment in 2008 and examines whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) either alone or in combination with aspirin will effectively reduce primary access failure of de novo arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) in patients with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease. Publication of new evidence derived from additional studies of clopidogrel and a high screen failure rate due to prevalent aspirin usage prompted an updated trial design.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" The original trial protocol published in 2009 has undergone two major amendments, which were implemented in 2011. Firstly, the primary outcome 'early thrombosis' at 3 months following AVF creation was broadened to a more clinically relevant outcome of 'AVF access failure'; a composite of thrombosis, AVF abandonment and cannulation failure at 12 months. Secondly, participants unable to cease using aspirin were allowed to be enrolled and randomised to omega-3 PUFAs or placebo. The revised primary aim of the FAVOURED study is to test the hypothesis that omega-3 PUFAs will reduce rates of AVF access failure within 12 months following AVF surgery. The secondary aims are to examine the effect of omega-3 PUFAs and aspirin on the individual components of the primary end-point, to examine the safety of study interventions and assess central venous catheter requirement as a result of access failure.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This multicentre international clinical trial was amended to address the clinically relevant question of whether the usability of de novo AVF at 12 months can be improved by the early use of omega-3 PUFAs and to a lesser extent aspirin. This study protocol amendment was made in response to a large trial demonstrating that clopidogrel is effective in safely preventing primary AVF thrombosis, but ineffective at increasing functional patency. Secondly, including patients taking aspirin will enroll a more representative cohort of haemodialysis patients, who are significantly older with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes which may increase event rates and the power of the study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" Australia &amp; New Zealand Clinical Trial Register (ACTRN12607000569404).
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) adversely interact with aspirin, diminishing its antiplatelet effect and potentially placing patients at an increased risk for recurrent thrombotic events. This crossover study aimed to determine whether the topical NSAID diclofenac epolamine 1.3% patch or oral diclofenac 50 mg interfered with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin 325 mg. Twelve healthy men and women aged 18-50 were included. Participants were randomized into 5 treatment arms: aspirin, diclofenac potassium 50 mg, diclofenac patch, diclofenac potassium plus ASA 325 mg, and diclofenac patch plus aspirin. Platelet responsiveness was determined using whole-blood impedance aggregation (WBA) to collagen 1 μg/mL and arachidonic acid (AA) 0.5 mM and was sampled every 2 hours. No significant difference in platelet function was observed following the diclofenac patch and aspirin vs aspirin alone. Oral diclofenac produced a mixed effect with significant reduction in platelet inhibition at hour 2 and hour 8 following aspirin administration. Topical diclofenac does not significantly interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and may be a safer alternative to the oral formulation.
 While aspirin is a well-established and generally effective anti-platelet agent, considerable inter-individual variation in drug response exists, for which mechanisms are not completely understood. Metabolomics allows for extensive measurement of small molecules in biological samples, enabling detailed mapping of pathways involved in drug response.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We used a mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to investigate the changes in the serum oxylipid metabolome induced by an aspirin intervention (14 days, 81 mg/day) in healthy subjects (n=156). We observed a global decrease in serum oxylipids in response to aspirin (25 metabolites decreased out of 30 measured) regardless of sex. This decrease was concomitant with a significant decrease in serum linoleic acid levels (-19%, P=1.3×10(-5)), one of the main precursors for oxylipid synthesis. Interestingly, several linoleic acid-derived oxylipids were not significantly associated with arachidonic-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, a widely accepted marker of aspirin response, but were significantly correlated with platelet reactivity in response to collagen.S:  Together, these results suggest that linoleic acid-derived oxylipids may contribute to the non-COX1 mediated variability in response to aspirin. Pharmacometabolomics allowed for more comprehensive interrogation of mechanisms of action of low dose aspirin and of variation in aspirin response.
Cost-effective strategies to maintain healthy active lifestyle in aging populations are required to address the global burden of age-related diseases. ASPREE will examine whether the potential primary prevention benefits of low dose aspirin outweigh the risks in older healthy individuals. Our primary hypothesis is that daily oral 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin will extend a composite primary endpoint termed 'disability-free life' including onset of dementia, total mortality, or persistent disability in at least one of the Katz Activities of Daily Living in 19,000 healthy participants aged 65 years and above ('US minorities') and 70 years and above (non-'US minorities'). ASPREE is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral 100mg enteric-coated acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) or matching placebo being conducted in Australian and US community settings on individuals free of dementia, disability and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Secondary endpoints are all-cause and cause specific mortality, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, fatal and non-fatal cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), dementia, mild cognitive impairment, depression, physical disability, and clinically significant bleeding. To 20 September 2013 14,383 participants have been recruited. Recruitment and study completion are anticipated in July 2014 and December 2018 respectively. In contrast to other aspirin trials that have largely focused on cardiovascular endpoints, ASPREE has a unique composite primary endpoint to better capture the overall risk and benefit of aspirin to extend healthy independent lifespan in older adults in the US and Australia.
"" To evaluate complications and safety of preconception low-dose aspirin in 1,228 U.S. women (2007-2011).METHODS:  Evaluation of the safety of low-dose aspirin in the participants and their fetuses was a planned secondary analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial, a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of low-dose aspirin on the incidence of live birth. Women aged 18-40 years with a history of one to two pregnancy losses trying to conceive were randomized to daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg, n=615) or placebo (n=613) and were followed for up to six menstrual cycles or through gestation if they became pregnant. Emergency care visits and possible aspirin-related symptoms were assessed at each study follow-up using standardized safety interviews. In addition, complications for both the participant and her fetus or neonate were captured prospectively using case report forms, interviews conducted during pregnancy and postpartum, and medical records.RESULTS:  The proportion of women with at least one possible aspirin-related symptom during the trial was similar between treatment arms (456 [74%] low-dose aspirin compared with 447 [73%] placebo, P=.65) as was the proportion with at least one emergency care visit (104 [17%] low-dose aspirin compared with 99 [16%] placebo, P=.76). Maternal complications were evenly distributed by treatment arm with the exception of vaginal bleeding, which was more commonly reported in the low-dose aspirin arm (22% compared with 17%, P=.02). The distribution of fetal and neonatal complications-which included three stillbirths, three neonatal deaths, and 10 neonates with birth defect(s)-was similar between treatment arms.: "" Although rare but serious complications resulting from low-dose aspirin cannot be ruled out, preconception low-dose aspirin appears to be well tolerated by women trying to conceive, women who become pregnant, and by their fetuses and neonates.
"AIM" The Fish oils and Aspirin in Vascular access OUtcomes in REnal Disease (FAVOURED) trial investigated whether 3 months of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, either alone or in combination with aspirin, will effectively reduce primary access failure of de novo arteriovenous fistulae. This report presents the baseline characteristics of all study participants, examines whether study protocol amendments successfully increased recruitment of a broader and more representative haemodialysis cohort, including patients already receiving aspirin, and contrasts Malaysian participants with those from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK).METHOD: "METHOD" This international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients older than 19 years with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease currently receiving, or planned within 12 months to receive haemodialysis.RESULTS:  Participants (n = 568) were overweight (28.6 ± 7.3 kg/m(2) ), relatively young (54.8 ± 14.3 years), and predominantly male (63%) with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (46%) but low rate of ischaemic heart disease (8%). Sixty one percent were planned for lower arm arteriovenous fistula creation. Malaysian participants (n = 156) were younger (51.8 ± 13.6 years vs 57.1 ± 14.2 years, P < 0.001) with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (65% vs 43%, P < 0.001), but less ischaemic heart disease (5% vs 14%, P < 0.01) compared with the combined Australian, New Zealand and UK cohort (n = 228). Protocol modifications allowing for inclusion of patients receiving aspirin increased the prevalence of co-morbidities compared with the original cohort.S:  The FAVOURED study participants, while mostly similar to patients in contemporary national registry reports and comparable recent clinical trials, were on average younger and had less ischaemic heart disease. These differences were reduced as a consequence of including patients already receiving aspirin.
Thyroid antibodies are frequently observed in urticaria patients, but their roles in urticaria are not clearly elucidated. We investigated the role of serum specific IgE to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) in patients with aspirin intolerant acute urticaria (AIAU) and aspirin intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU). We recruited 59 AIAU and 96 AICU patients with 69 normal controls (NC). Serum specific IgE to TPO was measured by manual direct ELISA, and CD203c expressions on basophil with additions of TPO were measured to prove a direct role of TPO in effector cells. The prevalences of serum specific IgE to TPO were significantly higher in AIAU (15.2%) and AICU groups (7.5%) compared to NC (0%, P=0.018: P=0.013, respectively). Flow cytometry showed CD203c induction in a dose dependent manner with serial additions of TPO in some AIAU and AICU patients having high specific IgE to TPO. Our findings show that the prevalence of serum specific IgE to TPO was significantly higher in both AIAU and AICU patients than in NC. It is suggested that specific IgE to TPO play a pathogenic role in AIAU and AICU. 
 Prasugrel and ticagrelor, new P2Y12-adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists, are associated with greater pharmacodynamic inhibition and reduction of cardiovascular events compared with clopidogrel in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. However, evidence is lacking about the effects of achieving faster and stronger cyclooxygenase inhibition with intravenous lysine acetylsalicylate (LA) compared with oral aspirin on prasugrel-inhibited platelets.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" This was a prospective, randomized, single-center, open, 2-period crossover platelet function study conducted in 30 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a loading dose of intravenous LA 450 mg plus oral prasugrel 60 mg or loading dose of aspirin 300 mg plus prasugrel 60 mg orally in a crossover fashion after a 2-week washout period between treatments. Platelet function was evaluated at baseline, 30 minutes, 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h using light transmission aggregometry and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. The primary end point of the study, inhibition of platelet aggregation after arachidonic acid 1.5 mmol/L at 30 minutes, was significantly higher in subjects treated with LA compared with aspirin: 85.3% versus 44.3%, respectively, P=0.003. This differential effect was observed at 1 hour (P=0.002) and 4 hours (P=0.048), but not at 24 hours. Subjects treated with LA presented less variability and faster and greater inhibition of platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid compared with aspirin.S:  The administration of intravenous LA resulted in a significant reduction of platelet reactivity compared with oral aspirin on prasugrel-inhibited platelets. Loading dose of LA achieves an earlier platelet inhibition and with less variability than aspirin.
 The CURRENT-OASIS-7 and PLATO trials suggest that the benefit of clopidogrel is influenced by the dose of aspirin.: "" To explore a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between aspirin and clopidogrel, and determinants of clopidogrel active metabolite (AM) levels.METHODS:  In part 1, using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we randomized patients to clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose (LD) followed by 150 mg day(-1) for 6 days and 75 mg day(-1) thereafter, or clopidogrel 300 mg LD followed by 75 mg day(-1) thereafter, and compared aspirin at 325 mg or 81 mg day(-1) . In part 2, patients were given a 600-mg clopidogrel LD, and were randomly allocated to aspirin 325 mg or 81 mg day(-1) . We combine the data from the two parts. Blood samples were collected 1 h after administration of the study drug.RESULTS:  We randomized 302 patients (mean age 60.4 ± 9.9 years). Clopidogrel AM levels were similar in patients randomized to aspirin 325 or 81 mg (geometric mean, 12.70 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 10.96-14.72 ng mL(-1) ; and geometric mean, 12.55 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 10.80-14.58 ng mL(-1) ; P = 0.91). Blood levels of clopidogrel were lower in CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function (LOF) carriers compared with non-carriers (10.72 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 8.83-13.01 ng mL(-1) ; and 15.21 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 13.30-17.40 ng mL(-1) , respectively; P = 0.003) whereas levels in gain of function carriers and non-carriers were similar (13.31 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 11.53-15.35 ng mL(-1) ; and 14.07 ng mL(-1) ; 95% CI, 11.74-16.87 ng mL(-1) , respectively; P = 0.4). Independent baseline predictors of clopidogrel AM levels were LOF genotype, body mass index, diabetes, proton pump inhibitor use and creatinine clearance, but accounted for only 20% of the variability in levels.: "" Aspirin dose does not predict clopidogrel AM levels 1 h post-LD. Most of the variability in clopidogrel AM levels is not explained by patient characteristics or CYP2C19 metabolizer status.
 Warfarin and aspirin are used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). There are inherent challenges with both treatments, including variable and inconsistent benefit and increased bleeding risks. The availability of new anticoagulants offers some alternatives.: "" A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis to evaluate direct and indirect treatment data including aspirin, warfarin apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for the prevention of primary or secondary stroke in patients with AF.METHODS:  A comprehensive, systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized trials comparing aspirin, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in patients with AF requiring treatment for stroke prevention. Open-label and blinded designs were included if they evaluated any stroke or any bleeding event. Data on stroke and bleeding events were abstracted, verified, evaluated, scored, and entered into Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16 to generate a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. Direct and indirect comparisons were evaluated, and we looked for inconsistency in closed loop structures. Data are reported as rate ratios with 95% credible intervals. In addition, we reviewed variance statistics and explored variance with node-splitting models.RESULTS:  Our literature search yielded 30 articles, 21 of which were included. All treatments except aspirin reduced the risk of any stroke compared with placebo. Warfarin (0.43 [0.33-0.57]), apixaban (0.37 [0.27-0.54]), dabigatran (0.34 [0.21-0.57]), rivaroxaban (0.36 [0.22-0.60]), and aspirin with clopidogrel (0.73 [0.53-0.99]) were more protective than aspirin alone. Warfarin and the new anticoagulants were similar in the reduction of stroke, vascular death, and mortality. There was no difference in major bleeding between any treatment group. There were more nonmajor bleeding events when comparing warfarin and apixaban (1.83 [1.05-4.03]); no other differences between warfarin and the other new anticoagulants were found.S:  This mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis found similarity between warfarin and the new anticoagulants with the exception of one comparison, in which warfarin was associated with more non-major bleeding than apixaban. Thus, the new anticoagulants are therapeutically comparable when warfarin is inappropriate.
"" This trial was undertaken to determine the safety and efficacy of preoperative aspirin administration in a contemporary cardiac surgical practice setting.METHODS:  This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, single-center trial involved patients with stable coronary artery disease who were assigned to receive either 300 mg of aspirin or placebo the night before coronary bypass surgery. Using a random digit table, patients were allocated to receive the tablet from 1 of the 40 coded bottles containing either aspirin or placebo. Patients, surgeons, anesthetists, and investigators were all masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety end points were as follows: more than 750 mL of bleeding during the first postoperative 12 hours and more than 1000 mL of total discharge from the chest drains. The secondary efficacy end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization.RESULTS:  A total of 390 patients were allocated to aspirin (387 analyzed) and 399 to placebo (396 analyzed). The follow-up median was 53 months. Fifty-four placebo recipients and 86 aspirin recipients bled more than 750 mL in the first 12 hours (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.63), while total chest drain discharge was above 1000 mL in 96 placebo and 131 aspirin recipients (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.17-2.18). Preoperative aspirin decreased the long-term hazard of nonfatal coronary event (infarction or repeat revascularization)-hazard ratio (HR), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33-0.99)--and tended to decrease the hazard of a major cardiac event (cardiovascular death, infarction, or repeat revascularization--HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41-1.03]).S:  Performing coronary grafts on aspirin is associated with increased postoperative bleeding but may decrease the long-term hazard of coronary events.
"Importance" "UNASSIGNED"Vascular access dysfunction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients requiring hemodialysis. Arteriovenous fistulae are preferred over synthetic grafts and central venous catheters due to superior long-term outcomes and lower health care costs, but increasing their use is limited by early thrombosis and maturation failure. ω-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oils) have pleiotropic effects on vascular biology and inflammation and aspirin impairs platelet aggregation, which may reduce access failure.Objective: "Objective" "UNASSIGNED"To determine whether fish oil supplementation (primary objective) or aspirin use (secondary objective) is effective in reducing arteriovenous fistula failure.Design, Setting, and Participants: "Design, Setting, and Participants" "UNASSIGNED"The Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oils) and Aspirin in Vascular Access Outcomes in Renal Disease (FAVOURED) study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial that recruited participants with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease from 2008 to 2014 at 35 dialysis centers in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Participants were observed for 12 months after arteriovenous fistula creation.Interventions: "Interventions" "UNASSIGNED"Participants were randomly allocated to receive fish oil (4 g/d) or matching placebo. A subset (n = 406) was also randomized to receive aspirin (100 mg/d) or matching placebo. Treatment started 1 day prior to surgery and continued for 12 weeks.Main Outcomes and Measures: "Main Outcomes and Measures" "UNASSIGNED"The primary outcome was fistula failure, a composite of fistula thrombosis and/or abandonment and/or cannulation failure, at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome.Results: "Results" "UNASSIGNED"Of 1415 eligible participants, 567 were randomized (359 [63%] male, 298 [53%] white, 264 [47%] with diabetes; mean [SD] age, 54.8 [14.3] y). The same proportion of fistula failures occurred in the fish oil and placebo arms (128 of 270 [47%] vs 125 of 266 [47%]; relative risk [RR] adjusted for aspirin use, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.23; P = .78). Fish oil did not reduce fistula thrombosis (60 [22%] vs 61 [23%]; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72-1.34; P = .90), abandonment (51 [19%] vs 58 [22%]; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62-1.22; P = .43), or cannulation failure (108 [40%] vs 104 [39%]; RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.83-1.26; P = .81). The risk of fistula failure was similar between the aspirin and placebo arms (87 of 194 [45%] vs 83 of 194 [43%]; RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.31; P = .68).Conclusions and Relevance: "Conclusions and Relevance" "UNASSIGNED"Neither fish oil supplementation nor aspirin use reduced failure of new arteriovenous fistulae within 12 months of surgery.Trial Registration: "Trial Registration" "UNASSIGNED"anzctr.org.au Identifier: CTRN12607000569404.
 The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial showed that the combined treatment of clopidogrel and aspirin decreases the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing hemorrhage in comparison with aspirin alone, but provided insufficient data to establish whether the benefit persisted over a longer period of time beyond the trial termination. We report the 1-year follow-up outcomes of this trial.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China. We randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after onset of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack to clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1, followed by 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 90 days, plus 75 mg of aspirin per day for the first 21 days) or to the aspirin-alone group (75 mg/d for 90 days). The primary outcome was stroke event (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 1-year follow-up. Differences in outcomes between groups were assessed by using the Cox proportional hazards model. Stroke occurred in 275 (10.6%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, in comparison with 362 (14.0%) patients in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.93; P=0.006). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in 7 (0.3%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 9 (0.4%) patients in the aspirin group (P=0.44).S:  The early benefit of clopidogrel-aspirin treatment in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke persisted for the duration of 1-year of follow-up.
Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Two separate randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the effects of multiple doses of vortioxetine (10 mg/day) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aspirin and warfarin in healthy volunteers. In the aspirin study, subjects received vortioxetine 10 mg or placebo once daily for 14 days, followed by coadministration with aspirin 150 mg once daily for 6 days, in 2 periods with a crossover design. In the warfarin study, subjects were randomized after reaching target international normalized ratio (INR) values on warfarin to receive vortioxetine 10 mg or matching placebo once daily for 14 days, with all subjects receiving a maintenance dose of warfarin (1-10 mg). Vortioxetine had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of aspirin or its metabolite salicylic acid, and no statistically significant effect on the inhibition of arachidonic acid-, adenosine-5'-diphosphate-, or collagen-induced platelet aggregation at any time points. Coadministration of vortioxetine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-warfarin enantiomers, or the mean coagulation parameters of warfarin treatment alone. Coadministration of vortioxetine doses in healthy volunteers had no effect on aspirin or warfarin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Vortioxetine was well tolerated when coadministered with aspirin or warfarin. 
 Preeclampsia (PE) increases maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Based on a multitude of data from randomized clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines endorse using ASA to prevent PE in women who are "at risk." However, data are lacking about the level of absolute risk to warrant starting ASA prophylaxis.METHODS AND FINDINGS: "METHODS AND FINDINGS" We present two approaches for objectively determining the minimum absolute risk for PE at which ASA prophylaxis is justified. The first is a new approach-the minimum control event rate (CERmin). The second approach uses a pre-existing concept-the minimum event rate for treatment (MERT). Here we show how the CERmin is derived, and then use the CERmin and the MERT to guide us to a reasonable risk threshold for starting a woman on ASA prophylaxis against PE based on clinical risk assessment. We suggest that eligible women need not be at "high risk" for preeclampsia to warrant ASA, but rather at some modestly elevated absolute risk of 6-10%.S:  Given its very low cost, its widespread availability, ease of administration and its safety profile, ASA is a highly attractive agent for the prevention of maternal and perinatal morbidity worldwide.
 Discontinuations and/or interruptions in aspirin therapy for secondary cardioprotection due to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) complications or symptoms have been shown to increase the risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. PA32540 is a coordinated-delivery, combination tablet consisting of enteric-coated aspirin (EC-ASA) 325 mg and immediate-release (IR) omeprazole 40 mg.METHODS:  Two identically-designed, 6-month, randomized, double-blind trials evaluated PA32540 vs. EC-ASA 325 mg in a secondary cardiovascular disease prevention population taking aspirin 325 mg daily for ≥3 months and at risk for ASA-associated gastric ulcers (GUs). The combined study population was 1049 subjects (524 randomized to PA32540, 525 to EC-ASA 325 mg). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of endoscopically-determined gastric ulceration over 6 months. Safety outcomes included the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and UGI symptoms.RESULTS:  Significantly fewer PA32540-treated subjects (3.2%) developed endoscopic GUs vs. EC-ASA 325 mg-treated subjects (8.6%) (P < .001). Overall occurrence of MACE was low (2.1%), with no significant differences between treatments in types or incidence of MACE. PA32540-treated subjects had significantly fewer UGI symptoms (P < .001) and significantly fewer discontinuations due to pre-specified UGI adverse events (1.5% vs. 8.2%, respectively; P < .001).S:  PA32540 reduced the incidence of endoscopic GUs compared to EC-ASA 325 mg, but with a similar cardiovascular event profile. Due to fewer UGI symptoms, continuation on aspirin therapy was greater in the PA32540 treatment arm.
"" We investigated the effects of oral administration of enteric coated aspirin (ASA) on blood pressure and blood pressure variability of hypertension patients before sleep.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We observed 150 hypertension cases, classified as Grade 1-2, from September 2006 to March 2008. They are divided into a control group with 30 cases, ASA I group with 60 cases and ASA II group with 60 cases randomly. Subjects in the control group had proper diets, were losing weight, exercising and maintaining a healthy mentality and were taking 30 mg Adalat orally once a day. Based on the treatment of control group, patients in ASA I group were administered 0.1 g Bayaspirin (produced by Bayer Company) at drought in the morning. Also, based on the treatment of control group, patients in ASA II group were administered 0.1 g Bayaspirin at draught before sleep.RESULTS:  The course of treatment is 3 months and then after the treatment, decreasing blood pressure and blood pressure variability conditions in three groups will be compared. Through the comparison of ASA II group with the control group, they have differences in terms of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), decreasing range of blood pressure and blood pressure variability (p < 0.05).S:  The oral administration of ASA before sleep has synergistic effects on decreasing blood pressure of hypertension patients and improving blood pressure variability.
"" The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of 100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy on high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We consecutively selected 98 cases high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients. After obtaining the informed consent of the patients, we randomly divided the patients into aspirin group (50 cases) and placebo group (48 cases). The oral intake of aspirin lasted from the final diagnosis of pregnancy to antepartum time, and was taken before sleep. The bleeding index was closely detected and we stop taking aspirin when necessary.RESULTS:  The comparison of clinical outcome showed that the incidents of pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia of aspirin group were significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p<0.05). Comparing the complications of fetus perinatal period, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05).S:  100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy is safe, effective and worthy of generalization to high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.
 Thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase is the only approved treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. After alteplase-induced recanalisation, reocclusion occurs in 14-34% of patients, probably because of platelet activation. Early administration of antiplatelet therapy after alteplase could reduce the risk of reocclusion and improve outcome. We compared the effects of early addition of intravenous aspirin to alteplase with standard alteplase without aspirin.METHODS:  In this multicentre, randomised, open-label trial with blind-endpoint assessment, patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with alteplase were randomly assigned to 300 mg intravenous aspirin within 90 min after start of alteplase treatment or to no additional treatment. In both groups, oral antiplatelet therapy was started 24 h after alteplase treatment. The primary endpoint was favourable outcome, defined as a score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin scale at 3 months. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR822).FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Between July 29, 2008, and April 20, 2011, 642 patients (322 patients aspirin, 320 patients standard treatment) of the targeted 800 patients were enrolled. At that time, the trial was terminated prematurely because of an excess of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH) and no evidence of benefit in the aspirin group. At 3 months, 174 (54·0%) patients in the aspirin group versus 183 (57·2%) patients in the standard treatment group had a favourable outcome (absolute difference -3·2%, 95% CI -10·8 to 4·2; crude relative risk 0·94, 0·82 to 1·09, p=0·42). Adjusted odds ratio was 0·91 (95% CI 0·66-1·26, p=0·58). SICH occurred more often in the aspirin group (14 [4·3%] patients) than in the standard treatment group (five [1·6%]; absolute difference 2·8%, 95% CI 0·2-5·4; p=0·04). SICH was more often the cause of poor outcome in the aspirin group compared with the standard treatment group (11 vs 1, p=0·006).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Early administration of intravenous aspirin in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with alteplase does not improve outcome at 3 months and increases the risk of SICH. The results of this trial do not support a change of the current guidelines, which advise to start antiplatelet therapy 24 h after alteplase.FUNDING: "FUNDING" The Dutch Heart Foundation.
 This study describes the implications of the pharmacokinetics of low-dose chewable aspirin for acute coronary syndromes. Current guidelines recommend the administration of 162-325 mg aspirin chewing tablets for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Although aspirin is widely used and a cornerstone in myocardial infarction, there is no information available on the pharmacokinetics of low doses of chewable aspirin.: "" This prospective trial assessed the pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid and its metabolite salicylic acid after intake of 162 mg chewable low-dose aspirin in 35 healthy volunteers. Plasma drug and metabolite levels were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography, and corresponding pharmacodynamics were determined by impedance aggregometry.RESULTS:  Acetylsalicylic acid was rapidly absorbed with a mean Tmax of 27 ± 8 min. Tmax of salicylic acid was 69 ± 21 min. Mean Cmax was 1·8 ± 0·6 mg/L and 7·6 ± 1·4 for acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid, respectively. Arachidonic acid-induced aggregation showed maximum platelet inhibition 30 min after drug ingestion.S:  The characterization of the plasma-time profile fills the gap between the lack of data on pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics and the recommendation for using low-dose chewable aspirin for acute coronary syndromes. We describe for the first time that a 162-mg dose of chewable aspirin is rapidly absorbed and achieves plasma concentrations of the active metabolite salicylic acid required to maximally inhibit platelet aggregation. However, a 162-mg dose is truly a minimum, and doubling this dose might be better for patients with myocardial infarction.
 Observational studies report reduced colorectal cancer in regular aspirin consumers. Randomised controlled trials have shown reduced risk of adenomas but none have employed prevention of colorectal cancer as a primary endpoint. The CAPP2 trial aimed to investigate the antineoplastic effects of aspirin and a resistant starch in carriers of Lynch syndrome, the major form of hereditary colorectal cancer; we now report long-term follow-up of participants randomly assigned to aspirin or placebo.METHODS:  In the CAPP2 randomised trial, carriers of Lynch syndrome were randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to 600 mg aspirin or aspirin placebo or 30 g resistant starch or starch placebo, for up to 4 years. Randomisation was in blocks of 16 with provision for optional single-agent randomisation and extended postintervention double-blind follow-up; participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was development of colorectal cancer. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered, ISRCTN59521990.RESULTS:  861 participants were randomly assigned to aspirin or aspirin placebo. At a mean follow-up of 55·7 months, 48 participants had developed 53 primary colorectal cancers (18 of 427 randomly assigned to aspirin, 30 of 434 to aspirin placebo). Intention-to-treat analysis of time to first colorectal cancer showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·63 (95% CI 0·35-1·13, p=0·12). Poisson regression taking account of multiple primary events gave an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0·56 (95% CI 0·32-0·99, p=0·05). For participants completing 2 years of intervention (258 aspirin, 250 aspirin placebo), per-protocol analysis yielded an HR of 0·41 (0·19-0·86, p=0·02) and an IRR of 0·37 (0·18-0·78, p=0·008). No data for adverse events were available postintervention; during the intervention, adverse events did not differ between aspirin and placebo groups.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" 600 mg aspirin per day for a mean of 25 months substantially reduced cancer incidence after 55·7 months in carriers of hereditary colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to establish the optimum dose and duration of aspirin treatment.FUNDING: "FUNDING" European Union; Cancer Research UK; Bayer Corporation; National Starch and Chemical Co; UK Medical Research Council; Newcastle Hospitals trustees; Cancer Council of Victoria Australia; THRIPP South Africa; The Finnish Cancer Foundation; SIAK Switzerland; Bayer Pharma.
 Nondisabling cerebrovascular events represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease with a high risk of recurrent stroke. A recent trial demonstrated that dual-antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin), compared with aspirin monotherapy, reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic events. Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, has been proven to be as safe and effective as traditional anticoagulants while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke might benefit from apixaban treatment; therefore, an adequately powered randomized study is needed.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" The ADANCE [Apixaban Versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) in Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events] study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 5,500 patients. A 21-day regimen of apixaban or of clopidogrel with aspirin followed by clopidogrel on days 22 through 90 will be administered to randomized participants with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with any new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage), including fatal stroke, at day 21. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, and at days 7, 22, and 90.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" The novel oral anticoagulant apixaban has been widely used with fewer adverse effects than traditional anticoagulants. We designed the ADANCE trial to observe the effects of apixaban on recurrent stroke after TIA or minor stroke. The results should better guide the selection of anticoagulant or dual-antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke.
 In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) the risk of recurrent VTE remains high after anticoagulant treatment is discontinued. The Aspirin for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (the Warfarin and Aspirin [WARFASA]) and the Aspirin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (ASPIRE) trials showed that aspirin reduces this risk, but they were not individually powered to detect treatment effects for particular outcomes or subgroups.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" An individual patient data analysis of these trials was planned, before their results were known, to assess the effect of aspirin versus placebo on recurrent VTE, major vascular events (recurrent VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular disease death) and bleeding, overall and within predefined subgroups. The primary analysis, for VTE, was by intention to treat using time-to-event data. Of 1224 patients, 193 had recurrent VTE over 30.4 months' median follow-up. Aspirin reduced recurrent VTE (7.5%/yr versus 5.1%/yr; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.90; P=0.008), including both deep-vein thrombosis (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.92; P=0.01) and pulmonary embolism (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06; P=0.08). Aspirin reduced major vascular events (8.7%/yr versus 5.7%/yr; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.86; P=0.002). The major bleeding rate was low (0.4%/yr for placebo and 0.5%/yr for aspirin). After adjustment for treatment adherence, recurrent VTE was reduced by 42% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40-0.85; P=0.005). Prespecified subgroup analyses indicate similar relative, but larger absolute, risk reductions in men and older patients.S:  Aspirin after anticoagulant treatment reduces the overall risk of recurrence by more than a third in a broad cross-section of patients with a first unprovoked VTE, without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: "CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL" www.anzctr.org.au.

"" Reduced effect of antiplatelet therapy following coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with reduced graft patency. We sought to evaluate the impact of hybrid coronary revascularization on the effect of aspirin and clopidogrel and whether high baseline platelet aggregation, high postoperative levels of platelet turnover, and acute-phase response may contribute to the effect.METHODS:  We prospectively studied platelet aggregation (VerifyNow and Multiplate Analyzer), platelet turnover (immature platelets, mean platelet volume, and thrombopoietin), and acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein, von Willebrand factor, and coagulation factor VIII) in 40 patients undergoing elective hybrid coronary revascularization (off-pump surgical revascularization through J-hemisternotomy followed by percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]). Preoperative blood samples on- and off-aspirin were compared with blood samples obtained postoperatively, following PCI when dual antiplatelet therapy had been initiated and at 1-year follow-up.RESULTS:  The antiplatelet effect of aspirin was significantly reduced in the early postoperative period as measured by VerifyNow Aspirin but not by Multiplate ASPI test. The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel was significantly reduced following PCI as measured by VerifyNow P2Y12 and Multiplate ADP test. The level of baseline aggregation did not predict the antiplatelet effect of aspirin or clopidogrel, and no association was found between platelet aggregation and postoperative platelet turnover or acute-phase reaction.
"" To compare the therapeutic warfarin and aspirin efficacies for treatments of atrial fibrillation (AF) complicated with stable coronary heart disease particularly in older Chinese patients.METHODS:  In our prospective study 101 patients with AF and stable coronary heart disease older than 80 years were randomized into two groups. One group (n = 51) basically received 1.25 mg/day warfarin per os, followed by addition of 0.5 - 1.0 mg/day from day 3 - 5 if the international normalized ratio (INR) was initially < 1.5 and in order to achieve a maintained INR between 1.6 and 2.5 (warfarin group). The second group (n = 50) received 100 mg aspirin per day (control group). All patients were medicated and monitored for a period of 2 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, and the composite secondary endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction and all causes of death. For safety evaluation, the hemorrhage rates were recorded.RESULTS:  The warfarin medication was superior regarding the overall occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism as well as non-fatal myocardial infarction and all causes of death outcomes compared to aspirin administration during the 2 years of medication (17.6% vs. 36.0%, p = 0.03), while there was no significant difference of mild (5 vs. 4), severe (2 vs. 1), and fatal (1 vs. 1) hemorrhage incidences between the warfarin and aspirin groups (p > 0.05).: "" Warfarin was found to be more efficacious than aspirin for an anticoagulation therapy of older Chinese patients with AF and stable coronary heart disease.
There are several reports of clinical trials of aspirin in sporadic colon cancer. However, only one double-blind trial of aspirin in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has been reported to date. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was therefore performed to evaluate the influence of low-dose aspirin enteric-coated tablets (100 mg/day for 6-10 months) in 34 subjects with FAP (17 each in the aspirin and placebo groups). The increase in mean diameter of colorectal polyps tended to be greater in the placebo group compared with the aspirin group, which showed a response ratio, that is, aspirin response rate (number of subjects with reduced polyps/total)/placebo response rate (number of subjects with reduced polyps/total), of 2.33 (95% confidence interval: 0.72-7.55). Subgroup analysis revealed that the number of subjects with a mean baseline polyp diameter of ≤2 mm, and the diameter and number of polyps after intervention showed a significant reduction in the aspirin group. Adverse effects of aspirin, such as anastomotic ulcer, aphtha in the large intestine, and progression of anemia, occurred in three subjects. Moreover, none of the subjects developed colorectal cancer. The results thus indicated a potential for aspirin to reduce colorectal adenoma development in patients with FAP, but careful follow-up is needed to avoid or rapidly counter severe adverse effects.
Aspirin is used for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention by millions of patients on a daily basis. Previous studies suggested that aspirin intake at bedtime reduces blood pressure compared with intake on awakening. This has never been studied in patients with CVD. Moreover, platelet reactivity and CVD incidence is highest during morning hours. Bedtime aspirin intake may attenuate morning platelet reactivity. This clinical trial examined the effect of bedtime aspirin intake compared with intake on awakening on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and morning platelet reactivity in patients using aspirin for CVD prevention. In this randomized open-label crossover trial, 290 patients were randomized to take 100 mg aspirin on awakening or at bedtime during 2 periods of 3 months. At the end of each period, 24-hour blood pressure and morning platelet reactivity were measured. The primary analysis population comprised 263 (blood pressure) and 133 (platelet reactivity) patients. Aspirin intake at bedtime did not reduce blood pressure compared with intake on awakening (difference systolic/diastolic: -0.1 [95% confidence interval, -1.0, 0.9]/-0.6 [95% confidence interval, -1.2, 0.0] mm Hg). Platelet reactivity during morning hours was reduced with bedtime aspirin intake (difference: -22 aspirin reaction units [95% confidence interval, -35, -9]). The intake of low-dose aspirin at bedtime compared with intake on awakening did not reduce blood pressure of patients with CVD. However, bedtime aspirin reduced morning platelet reactivity. Future studies are needed to assess the effect of this promising simple intervention on the excess of cardiovascular events during the high risk morning hours. 
 Hyperglycaemia may attenuate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin and thereby increase the risk of cardiovascular events. We investigated the influence of increased haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels on platelet aggregation and turnover in a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes or no diabetes.METHODS:  In this observational study, we included 865 stable CAD patients on 75 mg aspirin as mono-therapy of whom 242 patients had type 2 diabetes and were receiving antidiabetic drugs. Among 623 patients without diabetes, we classified 303 patients with prediabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7-6.4% [39-47 mmol/mol]) naive to antidiabetic drugs. Platelet aggregation was evaluated by the Multiplate Analyzer using arachidonic acid and collagen and by the VerifyNow Aspirin. Platelet turnover was evaluated by immature platelets using flow cytometry and platelet activation by soluble P-selectin.RESULTS:  CAD patients with type 2 diabetes had higher platelet aggregation (all p-values <0.01), platelet turnover (immature platelet count, p<0.01) and platelet activation (p<0.001) than patients without diabetes. CAD patients with prediabetes had increased platelet aggregation (p = 0.02) and platelet count (p = 0.02) compared with patients without diabetes. Increased levels of HbA1c correlated positively with increased platelet aggregation using arachidonic acid (r = 0.19, p<0.0001), collagen (r = 0.10, p<0.01) and VerifyNow (r = 0.15, p<0.0001), and with platelet count (r = 0.08, p = 0.01), immature platelet count (r = 0.11, p<0.001) and soluble P-selectin (r = 0.15, p<0.0001). These associations were mainly evident in non-diabetic and prediabetic CAD patients.S:  CAD patients with prediabetes and diabetes may have attenuated antiplatelet effect of aspirin compared with CAD patients without diabetes. This may be related to increased platelet count in patients with prediabetes. Increased levels of HbA1c correlated positively, though weakly, with increased platelet aggregation, platelet turnover and platelet activation.
Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an emerging risk factor in acute coronary syndromes. Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) with Collagen/Epinephrine (CEPI) is sensitive to functional alterations of VWF and also identifies patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR). The objective of this study was to verify the effect of double dose (DD) of aspirin and clopidogrel on HPR detected by PFA-100 and its relation to VWF and to its regulatory metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. Between 2009 and 2011 we enrolled 116 consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI with HPR at day 5 after PCI. Patients recruited were then randomized between a standard dose (SD, n = 58) or DD of aspirin and clopidogrel (DD, n = 58), maintained for 6 months follow-up. Blood samples for PFA-100, light transmittance aggregometry, and VWF/ADAMTS-13 analysis were collected after 5, 30, and 180 days (Times 0, 1, and 2). At Times 1 and 2 we observed a significantly higher CEPI closure times (CT) in DD as compared to SD (P < 0.001). Delta of CEPI-CT (T1 - T0) was significantly related to VWF (P < 0.001) and inversely related to ADAMTS-13 (0.01). Responders had a significantly higher level of VWF at T0. Finally, in a multivariate model analysis, VWF and ADAMTS-13 in resulted significant predictors of CEPI-CT response (P = 0.02). HRP detected by PFA-100 in acute myocardial infarction is reversible by DD of aspirin and clopidogrel; the response is predicted by basal levels of VWF and ADAMTS-13. PFA-100 may be a useful tool to risk stratification in acute coronary syndromes given its sensitivity to VWF. 
 Aspirin resistance occurs most frequently in diabetic patients and is associated with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of aspirin resistance in a cohort of diabetic patients and whether it can be reversed using more bioavailable aspirin formulations.METHODS:  Platelets function of 163 diabetic patients taking acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg daily has been evaluated with PFA100 and VerifyNow. Patients found resistant by at least one test received an infusion of 288 mg of lysine acetylsalicylate (Flectadol®) corresponding to ASA 160 mg. Platelets function was measured again after 1 and 24 h. Patients whose the resistance was reversed received 288 mg of soluble salt of lysine acetylsalicylate (Cardirene 160®) corresponding to ASA160 mg instead of aspirin and their aggregation status was re-evaluated after 1 month of therapy.RESULTS:  Prevalence of aspirin resistance in our population was 18,4 % (30/163). In 27 out of 30 patients (90 %) aspirin resistance was reversed within 24 h from the infusion. 25 out of 27 patients (92 %) were found fully aspirin-sensitive after 1 month of oral therapy with soluble salt; two patients were found with borderline value. No adverse reactions were observed.S:  A significant number of diabetic patients are resistant to aspirin therapy. A single intravenous dose of lysine acetylsalicylate can reverse the platelet hyper-aggregability and laboratory aspirin resistance in large majority of patients. The efficacy of antiaggregation can be maintained by chronic therapy with an oral drug with a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" In the SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes), ticagrelor was not superior to aspirin. Because of differences in patient demographics and stroke disease pattern in Asia, outcomes of ticagrelor versus aspirin were assessed among Asian patients in a prespecified exploratory analysis.METHODS:  Baseline demographics, treatment effects, and safety of ticagrelor and aspirin were assessed among Asian patients. Differences in outcomes between groups were assessed using Cox proportional hazard model.RESULTS:  A total of 3858 (29.2%) SOCRATES participants were recruited in Asia. Among the Asian patients, the primary end point event occurred in 186 (9.6%) of the 1933 patients treated with ticagrelor, versus 224 (11.6%) of the 1925 patients treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99). The exploratory P value for treatment-by-region interaction was 0.27. The primary end point event rate in the Asian subgroup was numerically higher than that in the non-Asian group (10.6% versus 5.7%; nominal P<0.01). Among the Asian patients, the rate of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)-defined major bleeding was similar in the ticagrelor group and the aspirin group (0.6% versus 0.8%; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.61).S:  The event rates were numerically higher in the Asian patients. Among the Asian patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attacks, there was a trend toward a lower hazard ratio in reducing risk of the primary end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death in the ticagrelor group.
 Interindividual variability in response to aspirin has been popularized as 'resistance'. We hypothesized that faster recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity may explain incomplete thromboxane (TX) inhibition during the 24-h dosing interval.: "" To characterize the kinetics and determinants of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 recovery in aspirin-treated diabetic and non-diabetic patients.PATIENTS/METHODS: "PATIENTS/METHODS" One hundred type 2 diabetic and 73 non-diabetic patients on chronic aspirin 100 mg daily were studied. Serum TXB(2) was measured every 3 h, between 12 and 24 h after a witnessed aspirin intake, to characterize the kinetics of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 recovery. Patients with the fastest TXB(2) recovery were randomized to aspirin 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily, for 28 days and TXB(2) recovery was reassessed.RESULTS AND S: "RESULTS AND S" Platelet TXB(2) production was profoundly suppressed at 12 h in both groups. Serum TXB(2) recovered linearly, with a large interindividual variability in slope. Diabetic patients in the third tertile of recovery slopes (≥ 0.10 ng mL(-1) h(-1) ) showed significantly higher mean platelet volume and body mass index, and younger age. Higher body weight was the only independent predictor of a faster recovery in non-diabetics. Aspirin 100 mg twice daily completely reversed the abnormal TXB(2) recovery in both groups. Interindividual variability in the recovery of platelet cyclooxygenase activity during the dosing interval may limit the duration of the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin in patients with and without diabetes. Inadequate thromboxane inhibition can be easily measured and corrected by a twice daily regimen.
 Subdural hematomas are an important bleeding complication of antithrombotic therapies. We sought to characterize the risk of subdural hematoma associated with antiplatelet therapy.METHODS:  Trials were gathered from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and from recent meta-analyses of trials regarding antiplatelet therapy for the primary prevention of stroke. Randomized trials published since 1980 comparing antiplatelet therapy with placebo or control and reporting subdural hematoma were included in the analysis. For recent large trials that did not report subdural hematomas, unpublished results were sought. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design and subdural hematomas, with differences resolved by joint review and consensus.RESULTS:  Four published trials were identified that compared aspirin with placebo/control involving 6565 participants (mean age 66 years) with 8 total subdural hematomas. Unpublished data from 5 aspirin trials with 90,689 participants reported 18 total subdural hematomas. The incidence of subdural hematomas varied from 0.02 per 1000 patient-years for primary prevention trials of middle-aged health professionals to 1 to 2 per 1000 patient-years for older patients with atrial fibrillation. Pooled data from all 9 trials revealed an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 0.8-3.5; heterogeneity P = .8; I(2) index 0%) for antiplatelet therapy and risk of subdural hematoma.S:  Based on the limited available data, it is uncertain whether aspirin therapy increases the risk of subdural hematoma: the observed 1.6-fold increased risk was not statistically significant. The incidence of subdural hematoma during aspirin therapy is low but varies widely depending upon the age of the patient population.
 Mechanisms for increased cardiovascular risk in HIV-1-infected adults are incompletely understood, but platelet activation and immune activation leading to a prothrombotic state have been proposed as significant contributors. Aspirin has antiplatelet and immunomodulatory properties. We explored whether 1 week of low-dose aspirin attenuates platelet activation and immune activation in HIV-1-infected and virologically suppressed adults on antiretroviral therapy.METHODS:  Platelet activation and immune activation were measured in HIV-1-infected subjects virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and controls before and after 1 week of low-dose aspirin.RESULTS:  Compared with control subjects, HIV-1-infected subjects had increased platelet activation, as measured by spontaneous platelet aggregation and aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and arachidonic acid. After aspirin therapy, percent aggregation decreased similarly in both HIV-1-infected and control subjects to all platelet agonists tested except aggregation in response to arachidonic acid, which remained elevated in the HIV-1-infected group. HIV-1-infected subjects exhibited increased markers of T-cell activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) and monocyte activation (sCD14), which decreased after 1 week of aspirin therapy. Moreover, leukocyte responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation were enhanced after 1 week of aspirin therapy. In vitro studies showed that HIV-1 plasma could activate healthy platelets, which in turn activated monocytes, implicating a direct role for activated platelets in immune activation.S:  Our data demonstrate that heightened platelet activation and immune activation in treated HIV-1 disease are attenuated by 1 week of aspirin therapy. Aspirin should be further studied for its antithrombotic and immunomodulatory benefits in treated HIV-1 disease.
Venous thromboembolic events (VTE's) are associated with decreased survival in breast cancer patients. Studies suggested that statins reduce the risk of VTE's in the general population. Low dose Aspirin reduces risk of VTE's in high risk populations. The Breast Cancer in Northern Israel Study is a case-control study of consecutive breast cancer cases diagnosed in northern Israel and matched controls. The present analysis was limited to cases with breast cancer enrolled in the study. Data was extracted from Clalit Health Services (CHS) database and from computerized pharmacy records. Out of 3,585 patients enrolled, 261 (7.3%) had a VTE during median follow up of 4.2 years. The 1 and 2 year cumulative incidence was 2.64 and 3.65%. 55.7% of patients used statins, predominantly simvastatin (75.8%). 44.5% used aspirin. In multivariate analysis neither statins nor aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk for a VTE. Unadjusted HR for statin and aspirin was 1.461 (1.018-2.096) and 1.293 (0.846-1.976), respectively, and the adjusted HR were 0.86 (0.648-1.14) and 1.013 (0.737-1.392). Results were similar when only simvastatin use was assessed. Metastatic disease, chemotherapy, age, BMI and presence of comorbidities were significantly associated with risk of VTE's. Our study is the first to look at the effect of statins and aspirin on the incidence of VTE's in patients with breast cancer. In our cohort, statin and aspirin use did not decrease the risk for a VTE. Our results might be explained by use of low potency statins (simvastatin and pravastatin) and by alternate mechanisms for VTE formation in patients with cancer.
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, given for 12 months remains the standard of care after presentation with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) because it has been shown to be associated with a significant reduction in ischemic events compared with aspirin monotherapy. The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was shown to be associated with a significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and resulted in a nominal reduction in cardiovascular death, when added to background DAPT in the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial; however, there was excessive bleeding with this "triple-therapy" approach. The combination of rivaroxaban with P2Y12 inhibition in a "dual-pathway" approach may be an effective therapeutic regimen for the treatment of ACS, given the known importance of P2Y12 inhibition after stenting and intriguing data that the combination of an anticoagulant with clopidogrel after stenting in patients with atrial fibrillation appears an attractive option to this patient population. GEMINI-ACS-1 is a prospective, randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, active-controlled trial that will assess the safety of dual antithrombotic therapy (rivaroxaban [2.5 mg twice daily] + P2Y12 inhibitor) as compared with DAPT (aspirin [100 mg] + P2Y12 inhibitor) within 10 days of an ACS event in 3,000 patients. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified by intended P2Y12 inhibitor use (clopidogrel 75 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily), with 1500 patients expected in each P2Y12 inhibitor strata. The primary end point is Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction clinically significant bleeding (major, minor, or requiring medical attention). The exploratory efficacy determination will be a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and stent thrombosis. GEMINI-ACS-1 will assess the safety and feasibility of dual antithrombotic therapy with rivaroxaban and a P2Y12 inhibitor compared with conventional DAPT for the treatment for patients with recent ACS. 
"" To evaluate if antimüllerian hormone (AMH) is associated with pregnancy loss.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Prospective cohort study within a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin.SETTING: "SETTING" Not applicable.PATIENT(S): "PATIENT(S)" Women (n = 1,228) were of ages 18-40 years with a history of one to two pregnancy losses and were actively attempting pregnancy without fertility treatment.INTERVENTION(S): "INTERVENTION(S)" Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)" Pregnancy loss.RESULT(S): "RESULT(S)" Relative risks (and 95% confidence interval [CIs]) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-detected and clinical pregnancy loss were assessed with the use of log binomial models with robust variance and inverse probability weights adjusted for age, race, body mass index, income, trial treatment assignment, parity, number of previous losses, and time since most recent loss. AMH levels were defined as: low (<1.00 ng/mL; n = 124), normal (referent; 1.00-3.5 ng/mL; n = 595), and high (>3.5 ng/mL; n = 483). Of the 1,202 women with baseline AMH data, 19 (17.3%) with low AMH experienced a clinical loss, compared with 61 (11.4%) with normal AMH and 50 (11.8%) with high AMH levels. Low or high AMH levels, compared with normal AMH, were not associated with clinical loss. Results for hCG-detected pregnancy loss mirrored those of clinical loss.(S): "(S)" AMH values were not associated with hCG-detected or clinical pregnancy loss in unassisted conceptions in women with a history of one to two previous losses. Our data do not support routine AMH testing for prediction of pregnancy loss.
The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy [clopidogrel + aspirin (ASA)] with respect to ASA on the protein expression of platelets from controlled type-2 diabetic patients with stable coronary ischemia. Patients had been taking ASA (100 mg day) and they were randomized to receive (n = 29) or not (n = 28) 75 mg day clopidogrel for 12 ± 2 weeks in a blind form. Protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The protein expression of a limited number of proteins such as actin-binding protein isotypes 2 and 5, lactate dehydrogenase, serotransferrin isotype 4, protein disulfide isomerase-A3 isotype 1, fibrinogen beta chain isotype 5, Ras-related protein Rab-7b isotypes 1 and 6, and immunoglobulin heavy chain was changed after dual antiplatelet therapy. Plasma level of platelet factor 4 (PF4), an in vivo marker of platelet activity, was not different between both groups. These changes suggest lower platelet reactivity after dual antiplatelet therapy in the studied patients. However, the variation in platelet proteome was lower than it would be initially expected, taking into account the apparent clinical beneficial effects of dual antiplatelet therapy. PF4 plasma level was not further decreased in the platelets treated for a longer time than 9-12 months with ASA + clopidogrel, as compared with ASA alone.
 Ticagrelor was shown to reduce mortality in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but its effect on graft patency is unknown.METHODS:  We performed a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, comparing ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo for 3 months added to aspirin 81 mg/day, following isolated CABG. Aspirin was started within 12 h, and study medication within 72 h after CABG. Primary outcome was graft occlusion on CT angiography (CTA) performed 3 months post CABG. Patients were followed to 12 months for death, myocardial infarction, stroke, repeat revascularisation and bleeding.RESULTS:  The study was terminated prematurely after randomising 70 patients between September 2011 and August 2014 because of slow recruitment. CTA was performed in 56 patients who completed >1 month of study drug. Graft occlusion occurred in 7/25 (28.0%) patients on ticagrelor and 17/31 (48.3%) on placebo, p=0.044. Of 207 analysable grafts, graft occlusion occurred in 9/87 (10.3%) with ticagrelor and 22/120 (18.3%) with placebo, p=0.112. Graft occlusion or stenosis ≥50% occurred in 10/87 (11.5%) ticagrelor vs 32/120 (26.7%) placebo, p=0.007. There was no major bleeding, but minor bleeding was higher with ticagrelor (31.4% vs 2.9%, p=0.003). In univariate analysis, ticagrelor use reduced graft occlusion (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.97, p=0.047), which remained significant on multivariable analysis (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.073 to 0.873, p=0.03).S:  Ticagrelor added to aspirin after CABG reduced the proportion of patients with graft occlusion, and was a significant univariate and multivariable predictor of graft occlusion. These results are hypothesis-generating and should be confirmed in larger studies.
Traditional assays of the coagulation status of patients, bleeding time assessment (BT) and light transmission aggregometry (LTA), are useful in clinical drug development. However, these assays are both labor intensive and expensive. BT results can be operator dependent and by its nature can inhibit subject enrollment in a clinical trial. The preparation of platelet-rich plasma necessary for LTA requires specialized training and laboratory support. Alternatives to these methods are desirable. The goal of this study was identification of a quantitative, easy-to-use, point-of-care device with minimal technical variables that could facilitate assessment of platelet aggregation in clinical drug development. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-period cross-over study in healthy volunteers designed to compare the abilities of BT, LTA, and three point-of-care devices, Multiplate®, Platelet Function Analyzer-100®, and VerifyNow® to quantitate the effects on platelet function of 3 days of treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, or placebo. The effect size (difference in treatment means divided by the pooled standard deviations [SD]) of the three point-of-care devices was greater than or similar to BT and LTA for all treatment comparisons examined. VerifyNow® had the highest effect size comparing ASA to placebo. Multiplate® had the highest effect size comparing clopidogrel to placebo. From this study, we conclude that any one of the three simple-to-use point-of-care devices can reliably assess the treatment effect of ASA and CLP on platelet function in comparison with BT or LTA at the study population level
 High quality evidence indicates that aspirin is effective in reducing colorectal polyps; and numerous epidemiological studies point towards an ability to prevent colorectal cancer. However the role of Aspirin as an adjuvant agent in patients with established cancers remains to be defined. Recently a nested case-control study within the Nurses Health cohort suggested that the initiation of Aspirin after the diagnosis of colon cancer reduced overall colorectal cancer specific mortality. Although this data is supportive of Aspirin's biological activity in this disease and possible role in adjuvant therapy, it needs to be confirmed in a randomized prospective trial.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" We hypothesize through this randomized, placebo-controlled adjuvant study, that Aspirin in patients with dukes C or high risk dukes B colorectal cancer (ASCOLT) can improve survival in this patient population over placebo control. The primary endpoint of this study is Disease Free Survival and the secondary Endpoint is 5 yr Overall Survival. This study will randomize eligible patients with Dukes C or high risk Dukes B colorectal cancer, after completion of surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy (+/- radiation therapy for rectal cancer patients) to 200 mg Aspirin or Placebo for 3 years. Stratification factors include study centre, rectal or colon cancer stage, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy (exposed/not exposed to oxaliplatin). After randomization, patient will be followed up with 3 monthly assessments whilst on study drug and for a total of 5 years. Patients with active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding diathesis or on treatment with aspirin or anti-platelet agents will be excluded from the study.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This study aims to evaluate Aspirin's role as an adjuvant treatment in colorectal cancer. If indeed found to be beneficial, because aspirin is cheap, accessible and easy to administer, it will positively impact the lives of many individuals in Asia and globally.
Many diabetics are insensitive to aspirin's platelet anti-aggregation effects. The influence of co-administration of aspirin and fish oil (FO) on plasma lysophospholipids in subjects with diabetes is poorly characterized. Thirty adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with aspirin (81mg/day) for seven days, then with FO (4g/day) for 28 days, then in combination for another seven days. Lysophospholipids and platelet measures were determined after acute (4h) and chronic (7 days) ingestion of aspirin, FO, or both in combination. FO ingestion reduced all lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) concentrations, while EPA (20:5n-3) and DHA (22:6n-3) lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) concentrations significantly increased after FO alone and in combination with aspirin. In vitro arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was most strongly correlated with palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) LPA and LPC concentrations at all time points. The ingestion of these agents may reduce cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic adults, with a disrupted lipid milieu, via lysolipid mediated mechanisms. 
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) has been used as an analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory drug for many years. A new 500 mg aspirin tablet formulation containing micronized active ingredient and an effervescent component has been developed for potential improvement in the onset of action for acute pain treatment. This paper describes the dissolution and the pharmacokinetics of the new formulation in comparison with regular aspirin tablets, aspirin granules and aspirin effervescent tablets. Micronized aspirin tablets dissolve significantly faster over a pH range from 1.2 to 6.8 compared to regular 500 mg aspirin tablets. Plasma concentration time curve comparison to regular 500 mg aspirin tablets showed a substantial improvement in the time to maximum plasma concentrations (T(max)) (ASA 17.5 min vs. 45 min) and an increase in maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) (ASA 13.8 μg/ml vs. 4.4 μg/ml) while the overall extent of exposure (AUC) remains almost unchanged. The data suggest a potential improvement for onset of action in treating acute pain with the new micronized aspirin formulation.
 Eosinophil activation is the key feature of upper and lower airway inflammation in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).: "" To investigate the mechanism of eosinophil activation and identify novel inflammatory mediators using proteomics.METHODS:  Thirty-two asthmatic subjects were enrolled: 18 AERD patients who showed positive responses to the lysine-aspirin nasal provocation test (L-ASA NPT) and 14 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients who showed negative responses to the L-ASA NPT (control group). Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) was collected before (baseline), at 10, 30 and 60 min (early response), and at 3 h (late response) after the L-ASA NPT. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and cysteinyl leucotriene (CysLT) levels were measured using an ImmunoCAP system and ELISA respectively. To identify proteins involved in AERD, comparative proteomics was applied using NLFs collected before and after L-ASA NPTs in AERD patients. The clinical relevance of identified novel proteins was evaluated by ELISA using NLFs from the AERD and ATA groups.RESULTS:  Eosinophil cationic protein and CysLT levels both increased significantly during the early response in AERD. ECP levels increased until the late response in AERD, while CysLT levels were not significantly increased during the late response. Proteomic analysis showed up-regulation of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), α2-macroglobulin (α2M) and ceruloplasmin (CP), with significant increases in NLF of AERD patients, which was significantly higher in AERD patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Significant correlations were noted between ECP and CysLT, ApoA1, α2M and CP levels during the early response in AERD patients.: "" Eosinophil activation occurred in early and late responses after L-ASA NPT in upper airway mucosa of AERD patients, where ApoA1, α2M and CP as well as CysLT may be involved in eosinophilic inflammation.
 The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.METHODS:  The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care-controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.RESULTS:  The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <iP</i>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<iP</i=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.S:  Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.
 Low-dose aspirin (LDA) has been proposed to improve pregnancy outcomes in couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss. However, results from studies of LDA on pregnancy outcomes have been inconsistent, perhaps because most studies evaluated LDA-initiated post-conception. The purpose of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial was to determine whether preconception-initiated LDA improves livebirth rates in women with one to two prior losses.METHODS:  We performed a multicentre, block randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Study participants were recruited using community-based advertisements and physician referral to four university medical centres in the US (2006-12). Eligible women were aged 18-40 years actively trying to conceive, with one to two prior losses. Participants were randomised to receive daily LDA (81 mg/day) or a matching placebo, and all were provided with daily 400-mcg folic acid. Follow-up continued for ≤6 menstrual cycles while attempting to conceive. For those who conceived, treatment was continued until 36 weeks gestation. The primary outcome was the cumulative livebirth rate over the trial period.RESULTS:  There were 1228 women randomised (615 LDA, 613 placebo). Participants had a mean age of 28.7, were mostly white (95%), well educated (86% more than high school education), and employed (75%) with a household income >$100 000 annually (40%). The characteristics of those in the treatment and placebo arms were well balanced.S:  We describe the study design, recruitment, data collection, and baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in EAGeR, which aimed to determine the effect of LDA on livebirth and other pregnancy outcomes in these women.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" WARCEF randomized 2,305 patients in sinus rhythm with ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.5) or aspirin 325 mg. Warfarin reduced the incident ischemic stroke (IIS) hazard rate by 48% over aspirin in a secondary analysis. The IIS rate in heart failure (HF) is too low to warrant routine anticoagulation but epidemiologic studies show that prior stroke increases the stroke risk in HF. In this study, we explore IIS rates in WARCEF patients with and without baseline stroke to look for risk factors for IIS and determine if a subgroup with an IIS rate high enough to give a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction can be identified.METHODS:  We compared potential stroke risk factors between patients with baseline stroke and those without using the exact conditional score test for Poisson variables. We looked for risk factors for IIS, by comparing IIS rates between different risk factors. For EF we tried cut-off points of 10, 15 and 20%. The cut-off point 15% was used as it was the highest EF that was associated with a significant increase in IIS rate. IIS and EF strata were balanced as to warfarin/aspirin assignment by the stratified randomized design. A multiple Poisson regression examined the simultaneous effects of all risk factors on IIS rate. IIS rates per hundred patient years (/100 PY) were calculated in patient groups with significant risk factors. Missing values were assigned the modal value.RESULTS:  Twenty of 248 (8.1%) patients with baseline stroke and 64 of 2,048 (3.1%) without had IIS. IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke (2.37/100 PY) was greater than patients without (0.89/100 PY) (rate ratio 2.68, p < 0.001). Fourteen of 219 (6.4%) patients with ejection fraction (EF) <15% and 70 of 2,079 (3.4%) with EF ≥ 15% had IIS. In the multiple regression analysis stroke at baseline (p < 0.001) and EF <15% vs. ≥ 15% (p = 0.005) remained significant predictors of IIS. IIS rate was 2.04/100 PY in patients with EF <15% and 0.95/100 PY in patients with EF ≥ 15% (p = 0.009). IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke and reduced EF was 5.88/100 PY with EF <15% decreasing to 2.62/100 PY with EF <30%.S:  In a WARCEF exploratory analysis, prior stroke and EF <15% were risk factors for IIS. Further research is needed to determine if a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction is obtainable with warfarin in HF patients with prior stroke and reduced EF.
"BACKGROUND AND AIM" Aspirin enjoys widespread use as an antithrombotic drug, but such ubiquity also increases the risk of gastrointestinal mucosal injury. Recent studies have shown that aspirin can also induce esophageal mucosal injury. We resolved to determine the intragastric pH value necessary to prevent aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury.METHODS:  15 healthy Japanese volunteers were dosed for 7 days in a four-way random crossover trial with 100 mg entero-coated type aspirin only once daily, 100 mg aspirin + 20 mg famotidine twice daily, 15 mg lansoprazole once daily, or 10 mg rabeprazole once daily. All subjects underwent endoscopy and intragastric pH monitoring on day 7.RESULTS:  7 individuals (46.7%) developed esophageal mucosal injury when ingesting aspirin alone. The incidence of esophageal mucosal injury was reduced however with concomitant dosing of aspirin and famotidine (26.6%; p = 0.193), lansoprazole (0%; p = 0.004), and rabeprazole (6.7%; p = 0.019). Among individuals for whom mean 24-h pH was >5.0 and who experienced pH <4.0 less than 40% of the time, none developed aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury.: "" Acid inhibition achieved with a half-dose of a proton pump inhibitor effectively prevented development of aspirin-induced esophageal mucosal injury, whereas a standard dose of a histamine-2-receptor antagonist failed to achieve the same results.
 Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are agonists of PPARγ and exert beneficial metabolic effects in patients with diabetes. They may also affect platelet function.S: "S" To characterize potential platelet inhibitory effect of pioglitazone alone and in the presence of aspirin.METHODS:  20 normal and 20 diabetic subjects were enrolled in a prospective study. On day 1, a blood sample was obtained at baseline and a second one after ingestion of 30mg of pioglitazone. PRP was prepared and platelet aggregation and release were evaluated using ADP, collagen and arachidonic acid as agonists. Subjects returned at 6-9days later after ingesting a single 81mg dose of aspirin and a third blood sample was obtained. The subjects then again ingested 30mg of pioglitazone and a fourth and final blood sample was obtained. Platelet aggregation and release were measured. PRP was incubated with thrombin to activate platelets, and the serum was separated and assayed for thromboxane B2, TGFβ and CD40L RESULTS: Pioglitazone alone did not affect aggregation with arachidonic acid. However, following ingestion of both aspirin and pioglitazone aggregation was significantly decreased compared to aspirin alone (P<0.0001). Pioglitazone also potentiated aspirin-induced inhibition of ATP release using either arachidonic acid or collagen. Following pioglitazone alone, TXB(2) release was 32,719±3,585pg/ml which was significantly reduced compared to baseline (42,075±4,479, P=0.0004). Pioglitazone also potentiated the inhibition of TXB(2) release by aspirin.: "" Pioglitazone inhibits platelet function and potentiates the inhibitory effects of aspirin.
"" Late timing of intervention and maternal obesity are potential explanations for the modest effect of aspirin for preeclampsia prevention. We explored whether low-dose aspirin (LDA) is more effective in women at increased risk when initiated before 16 weeks' gestation or given to non-obese women.METHODS:  Secondary analysis of a trial to evaluate LDA (60 mg/d) for preeclampsia prevention in high-risk women. Participants were randomized to LDA or placebo between 13 and 26 weeks. We stratified the effect of LDA on preeclampsia by (a) timing of randomization (< 16 or ≥ 16 weeks gestation) and (b) body mass index (BMI) class (non-obese and obese). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity was used to assess for variations in effect of LDA across gestational age and BMI groups.RESULTS:  Of 2503 women, 461 (18.4%) initiated LDA < 16 weeks. LDA effect was not better when initiated < 16 weeks (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.31) versus ≥ 16 weeks (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.75-1.08), (p value for interaction = 0.87). Similarly, LDA effect was not better in non-obese (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.7-1.13) versus obese women (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.7-1.13), (p value for interaction = 0.85).: "" LDA for preeclampsia prevention was not more effective when initiated < 16 weeks or used in non-obese women at risk for preeclampsia. No particular subgroup of women was more or less likely to benefit from LDA therapy.
The effects of inflammatory changes on the absorption of different-sized probes and their permeability ratios are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a pharmacological agent on the permeability of the gut mucosa to saccharidic probes of larger and smaller molecular weight. Permeability was assessed by half-hourly urinary excretion of a combined dose of d-mannitol, l-rhamnose and lactulose following consumption of a single 600 mg dose of aspirin and compared with a placebo in a cross-over study in 20 healthy female volunteers. The temporal patterns of excretion of all probes were bimodal, being best fitted by polynomial functions. The relatively small early peak was evident for at least 4 h for smaller sugars, but was less evident with lactulose, being overshadowed by a larger second peak. These conclusions were further supported by separate analyses of the segments of the temporal plots between 2.5 and 4 h and between 4.5 and 6 h. The forms of these curves did not change significantly following dosing with aspirin. A greater proportion of the total dose of mannitol than rhamnose was excreted over the collection period. Following the consumption of aspirin, the cumulative rate of excretion of the smaller sugars (i.e. mannitol and rhamnose) was significantly reduced whereas that of lactulose was increased over the 6 h collection period. Aspirin has opposite effects on the absorption of larger and smaller probes, influencing the outcome of the test. These results have important consequences for the design and comparison of clinical tests of permeability.
"BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS" It is not clear whether H<sub2</sub-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in aspirin users at high risk. We performed a double-blind randomized trial to compare the effects of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) vs a H2RA antagonist in preventing recurrent upper GI bleeding and ulcers in high-risk aspirin users.METHODS:  We studied 270 users of low-dose aspirin (≤325 mg/day) with a history of endoscopically confirmed ulcer bleeding at 8 sites in Hong Kong and Japan. After healing of ulcers, subjects with negative results from tests for Helicobacter pylori resumed aspirin (80 mg) daily and were assigned randomly to groups given a once-daily PPI (rabeprazole, 20 mg; n = 138) or H2RA (famotidine, 40 mg; n = 132) for up to 12 months. Subjects were evaluated every 2 months; endoscopy was repeated if they developed symptoms of upper GI bleeding or had a reduction in hemoglobin level greater than 2 g/dL and after 12 months of follow-up evaluation. The adequacy of upper GI protection was assessed by end points of recurrent upper GI bleeding and a composite of recurrent upper GI bleeding or recurrent endoscopic ulcers at month 12.RESULTS:  During the 12-month study period, upper GI bleeding recurred in 1 patient receiving rabeprazole (0.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1%-5.1%) and in 4 patients receiving famotidine (3.1%; 95% CI, 1.2%-8.1%) (P = .16). The composite end point of recurrent bleeding or endoscopic ulcers at month 12 was reached by 9 patients receiving rabeprazole (7.9%; 95% CI, 4.2%-14.7%) and 13 patients receiving famotidine (12.4%; 95% CI, 7.4%-20.4%) (P = .26).
"INTRODUCTION" In two, 6-month, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trials, PA32540 (enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg and immediate-release omeprazole 40 mg) compared to aspirin alone was associated with fewer endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients requiring aspirin therapy for secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention who were at risk for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events.AIMS: "AIMS" In this 12-month, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study, we evaluated the long-term cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of PA32540 in subjects who were taking aspirin 325 mg daily for ≥ 3 months for secondary CVD prevention and were at risk for aspirin-associated UGI events. Enrolled subjects received PA32540 once daily for up to 12 months and were assessed at baseline, month 1, month 6, and month 12.RESULTS:  The overall safety population consisted of 379 subjects, and 290 subjects (76%) were on PA32540 for ≥ 348 days (12-month completers). Adverse events (AEs) caused study withdrawal in 13.5% of subjects, most commonly gastroesophageal reflux disease (1.1%). Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 76% of the safety population (11% treatment-related) and 73% of 12-month completers (8% treatment-related). The most common treatment-related AE was dyspepsia (2%). One subject had a gastric ulcer observed on for-cause endoscopy. There were five cases of adjudicated nonfatal myocardial infarction, one nonfatal stroke, and one cardiovascular death, but none considered treatment-related.S:  Long-term treatment with PA32540 once daily for up to 12 months in subjects at risk for aspirin-associated UGI events is not associated with any new or unexpected safety events.
 Guidelines recommend stopping aspirin and clopidogrel 7 to 10 days before surgery to allow time for replacement of permanently inhibited platelets by newly released uninhibited platelets.S: "S" The purpose of the present study was to determine the rate of offset of the anti-platelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel after stopping treatment and the proportion of untreated donor platelets that are required to reverse their anti-platelet effects.METHODS:  Cohort 1 consisted of 15 healthy subjects who received aspirin 81 mg day(-1) or clopidogrel 75 mg day(-1) for 7 days and underwent serial blood sampling until platelet function testing results normalized. Cohort 2 consisted of 36 healthy subjects who received aspirin 325 mg day(-1), clopidogrel 75 mg day(-1), aspirin 81 mg day(-1) plus clopidogrel 75 mg day(-1) or no treatment for 7 days and underwent a single blood sampling.RESULTS:  In cohort 1, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced light transmission aggregation (LTA) returned to baseline levels in all subjects within 4 days of stopping aspirin, coinciding with the partial recovery of plasma thromboxane B(2) concentrations. ADP-induced LTA did not return to baseline levels until 10 days after stopping clopidogrel. In cohort 2, AA-induced LTA in patient treated with aspirin reached control levels after mixing with 30% untreated donor platelets whereas ADP-induced LTA in patients treated with clopidogrel reached control levels only after the addition of 90% or more donor platelets.S:  Platelet aggregation recovers within 4 days of stopping aspirin but clopidogrel must be stopped for 10 days to achieve a normal aggregatory response.
"INTRODUCTION" Variability in platelet response to aspirin has been reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery but has rarely been described in other operative settings and its mechanism remains uncertain. We performed a prospective cohort study to investigate the variability in platelet response to aspirin and to explore its mechanism in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.: "" Twelve aspirin-treated patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement were recruited. Once-daily aspirin was continued throughout the perioperative period. We measured platelet function using light transmission aggregation (LTA) in response to arachidonic acid (PL(AA)) and serum thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) at baseline (before surgery) as well as on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 after surgery. We defined aspirin low response as a PL(AA)>20%.RESULTS:  Six patients exhibited aspirin low response, which typically started on post-operative days 3 or 4; the remaining 6 patients had normal response to aspirin. Compared to aspirin responders, patients with aspirin low response showed significantly higher serum TXB(2) levels, a more pronounced early decrease in platelet count, and a significantly more rapid recovery of the platelet count after surgery.: "" Aspirin response variability occurred in patients after major orthopedic surgery, with one-half of the patients in our study exhibiting post-operative aspirin low response. Increased platelet turnover might be a contributor to aspirin response variability after orthopedic surgery.
BACKGROUND&amp; AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), but there are limited data from clinical trials to support this concept. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to assess the effects of the combination of aspirin (3 different doses) and esomeprazole on tissue concentrations of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) in patients with BE with no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia.METHODS:  Participants were recruited through the multicenter Cancer Prevention Network and randomly assigned to groups that were given 40 mg esomeprazole twice daily in combination with an aspirin placebo once daily (arm A; n = 30), with 81 mg aspirin once daily (arm B; n = 47), or with 325 mg aspirin once daily (arm C; n = 45) for 28 days. We collected esophageal biopsy specimens before and after the intervention period to determine the absolute change in mean concentration of PGE(2) (the primary end point).RESULTS:  Based on data from 114 patients, baseline characteristics were similar among groups. The absolute mean tissue concentration of PGE(2) was reduced by 67.6 ± 229.68 pg/mL in arm A, 123.9 ± 284.0 pg/mL in arm B (P = .10 vs arm A), and 174.9 ± 263.62 pg/mL in arm C (P = .02 vs arm A).
Aspirin has a range of antineoplastic properties linked to inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes in tumor cells, platelet inhibition and to inhibition of angiogenesis. We undertook a prospective study to determine the influence of a 45-day course of aspirin therapy on circulating and intraplatelet levels of selected proangiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) and antiangiogenic (thrombospondin-1 [TSP-1]) proteins, and platelet protein release in women diagnosed with breast cancer who were receiving tamoxifen therapy. Initiation of aspirin therapy increases serum and intraplatelet levels of TSP-1 without a corresponding increase in VEGF levels. Following aspirin therapy, VEGF levels decreased (relative to pretreatment levels) while TSP-1 returned to pretreatment levels. Plasma TSP-1 and VEGF levels did not change on aspirin therapy. Aspirin use also decreased thrombin receptor mediated release of TSP-1 and VEGF from platelets. The selective impact on platelet angiogenic protein content and release supports one mechanism by which aspirin can modify the angiogenic balance in women receiving tamoxifen therapy. Aspirin therapy appears to favor an overall antiangiogenic balance in women with breast cancer who are receiving tamoxifen therapy. 
Peripheral arterial stiffness and endothelial function, which are independent predictors of cardiac events, are abnormal in firefighters. We examined the effects of aspirin on peripheral arterial stiffness and endothelial function in firefighters. Fifty-two firefighters were randomized to receive daily 81 mg aspirin or placebo for 14 days before treadmill exercise in thermal protection clothing, and a single dose of 325 mg aspirin or placebo immediately following exertion. Peripheral arterial augmentation index adjusted for a heart rate of 75 (AI75) and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) were determined immediately before, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after exertion. Low-dose aspirin was associated with lower AI75 (-15.25±9.25 vs -8.08±10.70, p=0.014) but not RHI. On repeated measures analysis, treatment with low-dose aspirin before, but not single-dose aspirin after exertion, was associated with lower AI75 following exertional heat stress (p=0.018). Low-dose aspirin improved peripheral arterial stiffness and wave reflection but not endothelial function in firefighters.
Administration of heparin in the secondary prevention of placental vascular complications is still experimental. In women with a previous severe pre-eclampsia, we investigated the effectiveness of enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, in preventing these complications. Between January 2000 and January 2010, 224 women from the NOHA First cohort, with previous severe pre-eclampsia but no foetal loss during their first pregnancy and negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, were randomised to either a prophylactic daily dose of enoxaparin starting from the positive pregnancy test (n=112), or no enoxaparin (n=112). The primary outcome was a composite of at least one of the following: pre-eclampsia, abruptio placentae, birthweight ≤ 5th percentile, or foetal loss after 20 weeks. Enoxaparin was associated with a lower frequency of primary outcome: 8.9% (n=10/112) vs. 25 % (28/112), p=0.004, hazard ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (0.16-0.66), p=0.002. Enoxaparin was safe, with no obvious side-effect, no thrombocytopenia nor major bleeding event excess. This pilot study shows that enoxaparin given early during the second pregnancy decreases the occurrence of placental vascular complications in women with a previous severe pre-eclampsia during their first pregnancy.
 Treatment of low-dose aspirin (LDA)-induced small-bowel injury has not been established. Polaprezinc, a chelate of zinc and L-carnosine, may be efficacious for such injury. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled study to investigate whether polaprezinc is effective against LDA-induced small-bowel injuries.METHODS:  Consecutive patients under long-term (>3 months) LDA treatment and who agreed to participate in our study underwent initial capsule endoscopy (CE). Patients with LDA-induced small-bowel injury apparent upon initial CE (n = 20) were randomized into a polaprezinc (150 mg/day for 4 weeks) group and a control (no polaprezinc treatment) group. All underwent follow-up CE after 4 weeks. Changes in the number and characteristics of small-bowel mucosal injuries were compared within and between the two groups.RESULTS:  The median number of reddened lesions and erosions/ulcers upon follow-up CE in the polaprezinc group significantly decreased (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the median number of reddened lesions and erosions/ulcers upon follow-up CE in the control group.S:  Co-administration of polaprezinc may be effective against small-bowel mucosal injury associated with long-term LDA therapy.
 Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) affects a subset of patients with asthma. Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are a safe alternative in patients with AERD. Parecoxib is the first cyclooxygenase 2 selective drug for parenteral administration, especially useful after surgery thanks to its analgesic power. The aim of the study is to assess the tolerance of parecoxib (Dynastat; Pfizer) given by intramuscular route in patients with AERD.METHODS:  Patients evaluated were referred to the Pneumology and Respiratory Allergy Department of the Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain) for asthma exacerbations precipitated by 2 or more different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AERD was confirmed by a nasal challenge test with aspirin. Patients were challenged with parecoxib, and urine samples were collected to measure the leukotriene E(4) concentration.RESULTS:  Ten patients were challenged with parecoxib. No symptoms were reported with any of the administered doses, and there were no signs of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity. There were no alterations in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s or in acoustic rhinometry measurements. No significant differences between leukotriene E(4) levels were detected.: "" The drug was well tolerated by all patients, with no adverse reactions. This lack of reactions found in our study supports the fact that parecoxib could be a safe alternative in postsurgery analgesia in NSAID-intolerant asthma patients.
 Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug postmyocardial infarction, yet its optimal maintenance dose after percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting remains uncertain.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We compared outcomes of 10 213 patients with myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and were discharged on dual-antiplatelet therapy at 228 US hospitals in the Treatment with ADP Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) study from 2010 to 2012. Major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding within 6 months postdischarge were compared between high-dose (325 mg) and low-dose aspirin (81 mg) by using regression models with inverse probability-weighted propensity adjustment. Overall, 6387 patients (63%) received high-dose aspirin at discharge. Major adverse cardiovascular events risk was not significantly different between groups (high versus low: unadjusted 8.2% versus 9.2%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.17). High-dose aspirin use was associated with greater risk of any Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-defined bleeding events (unadjusted 24.2% versus 22.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.33), driven mostly by minor Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 1 or 2 bleeding events not requiring hospitalization (unadjusted 21.4% versus 19.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.34). Bleeding events requiring hospitalization were similar by aspirin dosing groups (unadjusted 2.8% versus 3.2%, adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.70). Similar associations were observed in landmark analyses accounting for aspirin dosing change over time, and across subgroup analyses by age, sex, baseline aspirin use, and type of ADP receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel versus prasugrel/ticagrelor).S:  Among percutaneous coronary intervention-treated patients with myocardial infarction, high-maintenance-dose aspirin was associated with similar rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, but a greater risk of minor bleeding than those discharged on low-dose aspirin.
Decreased oral clopidogrel absorption caused by induction of intestinal permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) expression after aspirin administration was observed in rats. This study evaluated the effect of aspirin coadministration on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel in humans. A single 75-mg dose of clopidogrel was orally administered before and after 2 and 4 weeks of once-daily 100-mg aspirin administration in 18 healthy volunteers who were recruited based on CYP2C19 and PON1 genotypes. Plasma concentrations of clopidogrel and its active metabolite, H4, and relative platelet inhibition (RPI) were determined. The P-gp microRNA miR-27a increased by up to 7.67-fold (P = 0.004) and the clopidogrel area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased by 14% (P > 0.05), but the AUC of H4 remained unchanged and RPI increased by up to 15% (P = 0.002) after aspirin administration. These findings indicate low-dose aspirin coadministration may decrease clopidogrel bioavailability but does not decrease its efficacy. 
Aspirin and celecoxib prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence. Genetic variants in the UGT1A6 enzyme are associated with delayed aspirin metabolism and greater chemopreventive efficacy. We examined the effect of combining aspirin and celecoxib in relation to UGT1A6 T181A and R184S variants among 1,647 patients in the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial who were stratified according to the use of low-dose aspirin after removal of adenomas and randomized to placebo, 200-mg twice daily, or 400-mg twice daily celecoxib for 3 years. Patients underwent follow-up colonoscopies at 1 and 3 years to assess on-treatment efficacy. At 5 years, 538 patients underwent a colonoscopy to assess risk of recurrence after treatment was discontinued for at least 1 year. During treatment, the relative risk (RR) of recurrent adenoma was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-0.79] for 200-mg twice daily celecoxib and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.46-0.64) for 400-mg twice daily celecoxib compared with placebo. Aspirin use was not independently associated with recurrent adenoma (RR, 0.98, 95% CI, 0.86-1.15). These results did not vary according to UGT1A6 genotype. However, among those with a variant UGT1A6 genotype on aspirin, the RR of adenoma was 1.60 (95% CI, 0.81-3.15) after withdrawal of 200-mg twice daily and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.06-3.70) after withdrawal of 400-mg twice daily celecoxib compared with withdrawal of placebo. In contrast, there was no increased risk associated with discontinuing celecoxib among any other groups. Concurrent use of low-dose aspirin does not influence the efficacy of celecoxib in adenoma prevention. However, discontinuing celecoxib among aspirin-using individuals who initially developed adenoma despite a UGT1A6 variant genotype resulted in rapid reemergence of disease.
 Regular aspirin use may decrease cancer risk by reducing chronic inflammation. However, associations between aspirin use and circulating markers of inflammation have not been well studied.METHODS:  Serum levels of 78 inflammatory markers were measured in 1,819 55- to 74-year-old men and women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Data were combined from three completed case-control studies and reweighted to the PLCO screening arm. Self-reported aspirin and ibuprofen use (number of tablets taken per day/week/month) over the previous 12 months was collected at baseline. Associations between (i) nonregular (<4 tablets/month), (ii) low (1-4 tablets/week), (iii) moderate (1 tablet/day), or (iv) high (2+ tablets/day) regular aspirin or ibuprofen use and marker levels were assessed with weighted logistic regression.RESULTS:  Aspirin use was nominally associated with (Ptrend across categories ≤ 0.05) decreased levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 15 [CCL15; OR, 0.5; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.3-0.8; moderate versus nonregular use]; soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2; OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0); soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1; OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) and increased levels of CCL13 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.1); CCL17 (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.9) and interleukin 4 (IL4; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9-2.8). Trends were not statistically significant following correction for multiple comparisons. Likewise, no statistically significant associations were observed between ibuprofen use and marker levels.S:  No significant associations were observed between regular aspirin use and the inflammatory markers assessed.IMPACT: "IMPACT" Additional studies are needed to better understand the relationship between aspirin use, chronic inflammation, and cancer risk.
Recent randomized trials have shown that cilostazol is superior to aspirin for secondary stroke prevention. We hypothesized that combining cilostazol with aspirin is more effective than aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This randomized study compared the effects of oral aspirin alone to aspirin plus cilostazol in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke within 48 h of stroke onset. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were checked before and after 14 days and 6 months of drug administration. The primary and secondary endpoints were neurological deterioration or stroke recurrence (NIHSS score ≥ 1) within 14 days and 6 months, respectively. For statistical analysis, on-treatment analysis was conducted. Seventy-six patients were enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was significantly higher in the aspirin group than in the aspirin plus cilostazol group (28% vs. 6%, relative risk (RR): 0.21, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.05-0.87, p=0.013). Among the patients who did not reach these endpoints, the mean improvement in the NIHSS score at day 14 tended to be better (-1.8 ± 1.2 vs. -1.2 ± 1.0, p=0.078) and the frequency of the favorable functional status of mRS 0-1 at month 6 was significantly higher (RR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.07-2.06, p=0.0048) in the aspirin plus cilostazol group than in the aspirin group. Patients treated with aspirin plus cilostazol during the acute phase of stroke had less neurological deterioration and more favorable functional status than those treated with aspirin alone.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Although aspirin is effective in prevention of stroke, fewer studies have examined the impact of aspirin on stroke morbidity.METHODS:  The Women's Health Study is a completed randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the effect of low-dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, which enrolled 39 876 women. We used multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between randomized aspirin assignment and functional outcomes from stroke. Possible functional outcomes were neither stroke nor transient ischemic attack (TIA), modified Rankin scale (mRS) score 0 to 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 6.RESULTS:  After a mean of 9.9 years of follow-up, 460 confirmed strokes (366 ischemic, 90 hemorrhagic, and 4 unknown type) and 405 confirmed TIAs occurred. With regard to total and ischemic stroke, women who were randomized to aspirin had a nonsignificant decrease in risk of any outcome compared to women not randomized to aspirin. This decrease in risk only reached statistical significance for those experiencing TIA compared to participants without stroke or TIA (odds ratio=0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.94). For hemorrhagic stroke, a nonsignificant increase in the risk of achieving an mRS score 2 to 3 or 4 to 6 compared with no stroke or TIA was observed for the women randomized to aspirin compared to those randomized to placebo.S:  Results from this large randomized clinical trial provide evidence that 100 mg of aspirin every other day may reduce the risk of ischemic cerebral vascular events but does not have differential effects on functional outcomes from stroke.
 Nasal polyposis frequently occurs within the clinical picture of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). A derailed arachidonic acid metabolism is regarded to be part of the pathophysiology of AERD, and aspirin desensitization is the only causal therapeutic option, so far. The optimal maintenance dose of aspirin desensitization to prevent nasal polyp recurrence on the one hand and to minimize aspirin-related side-effects, on the other hand, is still a matter of debate. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose aspirin desensitization protocol.METHODS:  After sinus surgery, 70 individuals with AERD were randomly allocated to a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled aspirin desensitization protocol with a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily. The primary outcome was polyp relapse after 36 months. Nasal endoscopy status, quality of life, and patients' symptom score as well as aspirin-related side-effects were monitored.RESULTS:  Due to the high dropout rate, only 31 individuals were evaluated. After 36 months, nasal polyp relapse was less frequent (P = 0.0785) and the polyposis score was lower (P = 0.0702) in the therapy group. Quality of life obviously improved (P = 0.0324), clinical complaints (P = 0.0083) were significantly reduced, and no severe aspirin-related side-effects were observed.: "" Aspirin desensitization with a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily has a positive impact on nasal polyp relapse and seems to be a safe and suitable therapy to improve clinical complaints and the quality of life of individuals with AERD.
 Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important complication after major orthopedic surgery. Pharmaceutical methods represent the main strategy of VTE prevention. The use of aspirin in VTE prevention is still controversial worldwide, especially in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of aspirin combined with mechanical measures in the prevention of VTE after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).METHODS:  Between January 2012 and May 2013 and in accordance with the inclusion criteria, 120 patients undergoing TKA were randomly allocated to two groups. To prevent VTE, patients in group A received aspirin combined with mechanical measures postoperatively, while patients in group B received low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) sodium and rivaroxaban sequentially in combination with mechanical measures postoperatively. All surgeries were performed by one surgeon using a posterior-stabilized cemented prosthesis. The two groups were followed up and compared for the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by duplex ultrasound scan and clinical VTE events. The adverse events, the blood loss index, and the cost of VTE prevention were also compared.RESULTS:  DVT was detected in 10 of 60 patients in group A (16.7%, 95% CI: 7.3%-26.1%) compared with 11 of 60 in group B (18.3%, 95% CI: 8.5%-27.8%) (P = 0.500). There is no statistical evidence supporting the inferior effect of aspirin in preventing DVT as compared with the other medications. There were no cases of symptomatic VTE or death during the follow-up period. Area of ecchymosis was lower in group A than in group B, and the differences were statistically significant. Patients in group A had the lower blood loss index as compared with patients in group B. No transfusion cases were found in both groups. The differences were statistically significant. The cost of VTE prevention analysis indicated a cost reduction using aspirin in group A compared with using LMWH and rivaroxaban in group B.: "" Aspirin combined with mechanical measures had a good effect on prevention of VTE after TKA and resulted in lower cost, less blood loss, and less subcutaneous ecchymosis.
 Patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events. We compared the selective thromboxane-prostaglandin receptor antagonist terutroban with aspirin in the prevention of cerebral and cardiovascular ischaemic events in patients with a recent non-cardioembolic cerebral ischaemic event.METHODS:  This randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was undertaken in 802 centres in 46 countries. Patients who had an ischaemic stroke in the previous 3 months or a TIA in the previous 8 days were randomly allocated with a central interactive response system to 30 mg per day terutroban or 100 mg per day aspirin. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, or other vascular death (excluding haemorrhagic death). We planned a sequential statistical analysis of non-inferiority (margin 1·05) followed by analysis of superiority. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study was stopped prematurely for futility on the basis of the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee. This study is registered, number ISRCTN66157730.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" 9562 patients were assigned to terutroban (9556 analysed) and 9558 to aspirin (9544 analysed); mean follow-up was 28·3 months (SD 7·7). The primary endpoint occurred in 1091 (11%) patients receiving terutroban and 1062 (11%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02, 95% CI 0·94-1·12). There was no evidence of a difference between terutroban and aspirin for the secondary or tertiary endpoints. We recorded some increase in minor bleedings with terutroban compared with aspirin (1147 [12%] vs 1045 [11%]; HR 1·11, 95% CI 1·02-1·21), but no significant differences in other safety endpoints.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" The trial did not meet the predefined criteria for non-inferiority, but showed similar rates of the primary endpoint with terutroban and aspirin, without safety advantages for terutroban. In a worldwide perspective, aspirin remains the gold standard antiplatelet drug for secondary stroke prevention in view of its efficacy, tolerance, and cost.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Servier, France.
 To verify the hypothesis that erythrocytes play a role in suboptimal blood platelet response to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD).METHODS:  In a cross-over randomized controlled intervention study we evaluated blood platelet response to 30-day treatment with 75 mg/d or 150 mg/d of ASA (enteric coated) in CAD patients (n = 125). In vitro platelet response to collagen or arachidonic acid was monitored with impedance aggregometry and plasma thromboxane B2 was assayed immunoenzymatically. Blood morphology and several plasma biochemical parameters were determined using routine diagnostic procedures.RESULTS:  CAD patients demonstrated lower blood platelet responsiveness to 75 mg/d of ASA compared to healthy subjects. The improved platelet responsiveness to 150 mg/d of ASA was particularly evident in "poor" responding patients. Positive correlations between platelet "poor" response to lower (75 mg/d) ASA dose and red blood cell count (Rs = 0.215; p < 0.04), haemoglobin (Rs = 0.232; p < 0.02) and haematocrit (Rs = 0.239; p < 0.02) were found in CAD patients. Association between "poor" platelet response with lower ASA dose was confirmed by conditional maximum likelihood logistic regression, which showed the independency between erythrocyte-derived parameters, as the risk factors for suboptimal platelet response to ASA, and other risk factors, like CRP or LDL-cholesterol. In "poor" ASA responders taking the higher ASA dose (150 mg/d) the correlation between platelets' response to ASA and erythrocyte-derived parameters was not significant.S:  Red blood cell parameters are associated with suboptimal blood platelet response to ASA in patients with CAD. Such a platelet refractoriness to ASA may be effectively overcome by increasing the ASA dose.
 Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin might positively affect pregnancy outcomes, but this possibility has not been adequately assessed. Our aim was to investigate whether low-dose aspirin improved livebirth rates in women with one to two previous pregnancy losses.METHODS: In this multicentre, block-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, women aged 18-40 years who were attempting to become pregnant were recruited from four medical centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by eligibility criteria--the original stratum was restricted to women with one loss at less than 20 weeks' gestation during the previous year, whereas the expanded stratum included women with one to two previous losses, with no restrictions on gestational age or time of loss. Women were block-randomised by centre and eligibility stratum in a 1:1 ratio. Preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg per day) plus folic acid was compared with placebo plus folic acid for up to six menstrual cycles; for women who conceived, study treatment continued until 36 weeks' gestation. Participants, trial staff, and investigators were masked to the assigned treatment. The primary outcome was livebirth rate, which was analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00467363" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00467363</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Overall, 1228 women were recruited and randomly assigned between June 15, 2007, and July 15, 2011, 1078 of whom completed the trial and were included in the analysis (535 in the low-dose aspirin group and 543 in the placebo group). 309 (58%) women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths, compared with 286 (53%) in the placebo group (p=0·0984; absolute difference in livebirth rate 5·09% [95% CI -0·84 to 11·02]). Pregnancy loss occurred in 68 (13%) women in the low-dose aspirin group, compared with 65 (12%) women in the placebo group (p=0·7812). In the original stratum, 151 (62%) of 242 women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths, compared with 133 (53%) of 250 in the placebo group (p=0·0446; absolute difference in livebirth rate 9·20% [0·51 to 17·89]). In the expanded stratum, 158 (54%) of 293 women in the low-dose aspirin group and 153 (52%) of 293 in the placebo group had livebirths (p=0·7406; absolute difference in livebirth rate 1·71% [-6·37 to 9·79]). Major adverse events were similar between treatment groups. Low-dose aspirin was associated with increased vaginal bleeding, but this adverse event was not associated with pregnancy loss.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with livebirth or pregnancy loss in women with one to two previous losses. However, higher livebirth rates were seen in women with a single documented loss at less than 20 weeks' gestation during the previous year. Low-dose aspirin is not recommended for the prevention of pregnancy loss.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (US National Institutes of Health).
 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is commonly used after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI); however, the supporting evidence is limited. To determine if aspirin alone is a better alternative to DAPT, we compared the outcomes of patients treated with DAPT or aspirin alone after TAVI.Methods and Results:We analyzed a total of 144 consecutive patients (92 females, mean age 83±6 years) who underwent implantation of a balloon-expandable transcatheter valve (SAPIEN or SAPIEN XT, Edwards Lifesciences). Patients were divided into DAPT (n=66) or aspirin-alone treatment groups (n=78). At 1 year after TAVI, the composite endpoint, which consisted of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and major or life-threatening bleeding complications, occurred significantly less frequently (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the aspirin-alone group (15.4%) than in the DAPT group (30.3%; P=0.031). Valve function assessed by echocardiography was similar between the 2 treatment groups with respect to effective orifice area (1.78±0.43 cm<sup2</supin DAPT vs. 1.91±0.46 cm<sup2</supin aspirin-alone group; P=0.13) and transvalvular pressure gradient (11.1±3.5 mmHg in DAPT vs. 10.3±4.1 mmHg in aspirin-alone group; P=0.31).S:  Treatment with aspirin alone after TAVI had greater safety benefits and was associated with similar valve function as DAPT. These results suggest that treatment with aspirin alone is an acceptable regimen for TAVI patients.
 Low dose aspirin reduces the secondary incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Drug resistance to aspirin might result in treatment failure. Despite this concern, no clear definition of aspirin resistance has emerged, and estimates of its incidence have varied remarkably. We aimed to determine the commonality of a mechanistically consistent, stable, and specific phenotype of true pharmacological resistance to aspirin-such as might be explained by genetic causes.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" Healthy volunteers (n=400) were screened for their response to a single oral dose of 325-mg immediate release or enteric coated aspirin. Response parameters reflected the activity of the molecular target of aspirin, cyclooxygenase-1. Individuals who appeared aspirin resistant on 1 occasion underwent repeat testing, and if still resistant were exposed to low-dose enteric coated aspirin (81 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) for 1 week each. Variable absorption caused a high frequency of apparent resistance to a single dose of 325-mg enteric coated aspirin (up to 49%) but not to immediate release aspirin (0%). All individuals responded to aspirin on repeated exposure, extension of the postdosing interval, or addition of aspirin to their platelets ex vivo.S:  Pharmacological resistance to aspirin is rare; this study failed to identify a single case of true drug resistance. Pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption, complicates enteric coated but not immediate release aspirin administration.
Edoxaban is an oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, an elderly population that frequently receives aspirin (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for concurrent illnesses. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of edoxaban 60 mg coadministered with low-dose (100 mg) ASA, high-dose (325 mg) ASA, or naproxen (500 mg) in healthy subjects (n = 126). Template bleeding times (BT) were measured. Mean baseline (predose) BT for the 3 studies ranged from 4.72 to 6.13 minutes. Edoxaban administered alone increased BT by 21%-35% (4 hours post dose) from baseline. Concomitant administration of edoxaban with high-dose ASA, low-dose ASA, or naproxen increased BT approximately 2-fold showing an additive effect greater than either agent administered alone. Edoxaban pharmacokinetics were not affected by concomitant low-dose ASA or naproxen, but high-dose ASA increased systemic exposure of edoxaban by approximately 30%. The effects of edoxaban on prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, anti-FXa, and intrinsic FXa activity were not influenced by administration with ASA or naproxen. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by high-dose ASA, low-dose ASA, or naproxen was not affected by edoxaban. Concomitant administration of edoxaban and ASA or naproxen was well tolerated.
"RATIONALE" The risk of recurrent ischemia is high in the acute period after ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Aspirin is recommended by guidelines for this indication, but more intensive antiplatelet therapy may be justified.AIMS: "AIMS" We aim to evaluate whether ticagrelor, a potent antiplatelet agent that blocks the P2Y12 receptor without requiring metabolic activation, reduces the risk of major vascular events compared with aspirin when randomization occurs within 24 h after symptom onset of a nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated with Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes (SOCRATES) is a randomized, double-blind, event-driven trial and will include an estimated 13,600 participants randomized in 33 countries worldwide to collect 844 primary events.STUDY OUTCOMES: "STUDY OUTCOMES" The primary endpoint is the composite of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, and death. Time to the first primary endpoint will be compared in the treatment groups during 90-day follow-up, with major hemorrhage serving as the primary safety endpoint. Participants will be followed for an additional 30 days after the randomized treatment period.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" The SOCRATES trial fulfills an important clinical need by evaluating a potent antiplatelet agent as a superior alternative to current standard of care in patients presenting acutely with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
"" To evaluate the effectiveness and safty of tranexamic acid in patients receiving on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without clopidogrel and aspirin cessation.METHODS:  The current study is a prospective, randomized and placebo-control trial. A total of 116 patients receiving selective on-pump CABG with their last ingestion of clopidogrle and aspirin within 7 days preoperatively were recruited. Despite 6 patients withdrawal their consent, the rest 110 were randomized to receive tranexamic acid or placebo. The tranexamic acid regimen was a bolus of 10 mg/kg followed by a maintenance of 10 mg·kg(-1)·h(-1) throughout the surgery. The primary outcome was the volume of allogeneic erythrocyte transfused perioperatively.RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. In patients receiving tranexamic acid and placebo respectively, the volume of allogeneic erythrocyte transfused was 4.0 (7.5) units and 6.0(6.0) units (W = 1021, P < 0.01). In these 2 groups respectively, blood loss was 930 (750) ml and 1210 (910) ml (W = 1042, P < 0.01), the incidence of major bleeding was 50.9% and 76.4% (χ(2) = 7.70, P < 0.01), the incidence of reoperation was 0 and 9.1% (χ(2) = 5.24, P = 0.02); the volume of plasma transfused was 400 (600) ml and 600 (650) ml (W = 1072, P = 0.01), the exposure of plasma was 60.0% and 85.5% (χ(2) = 8.98, P < 0.01) and the exposure to any allogeneic blood products was 85.5% and 98.2% (χ(2) = 5.93, P = 0.01). Perioperative mortality, morbidity and the incidence of adverse events were balanced between the groups without statistical significance.: "" Tranexamic acid reduced significantly postoperative bleeding and transfusion in patients receiving on-pump CABG without clopidogrel and aspirin cessation.
 Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication after laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (LSD) in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-2.5 for the prevention of PVST after LSD. Hitherto, this is the first study to assess the use of warfarin in this field.: "" We retrospectively analyzed a database of 73 consecutive patients who underwent LSD from January 2013 to September 2014. Patients were categorized into the warfarin group (34 patients) and the aspirin group (39 patients). The INR and incidence of PSVT were monitored for 90 days.RESULTS:  Compared with the aspirin group, the warfarin group had a lower incidence of PVST on postoperative day (POD) 30 [17/34 (50.0%) versus 29/39 (74.4%); P = .032] and POD 90 [8/34 (23.5%) versus 30/39 (76.9%); P < .0001] and main portal vein thrombosis (MPVT) on POD 90 [3 (8.8%) versus 13 (33.3%); P = .012]. From POD 30 to 90, the warfarin group achieved more complete recanalization of PVST [9/17 (52.9%) versus 3/29 (10.3%), P = .005] and MPVT [9/12 (75.0%) versus 3/12 (25.0%), P = .039]. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that warfarin was an independent protective factor for PVST at POD 90 (relative risk, 0.027; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.168; P < .001). No patients developed bleeding complications.S:  Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is safe and effective for the prevention of PVST in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension after LSD.
Most patients with coronary artery disease receive aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Aspirin poses a risk of bleeding in patients undergoing surgery, but it is unclear whether aspirin should be stopped before coronary artery surgery.METHODS: We used a 2-by-2 factorial trial design to randomly assign patients who were scheduled to undergo coronary artery surgery and were at risk for perioperative complications to receive aspirin or placebo and tranexamic acid or placebo. The results of the aspirin trial are reported here. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of aspirin or matched placebo preoperatively. The primary outcome was a composite of death and thrombotic complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery.RESULTS: Among 5784 eligible patients, 2100 were enrolled; 1047 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and 1053 to receive placebo. A primary outcome event occurred in 202 patients in the aspirin group (19.3%) and in 215 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.12; P=0.55). Major hemorrhage leading to reoperation occurred in 1.8% of patients in the aspirin group and in 2.1% of patients in the placebo group (P=0.75), and cardiac tamponade occurred at rates of 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively (P=0.08).S: Among patients undergoing coronary artery surgery, the administration of preoperative aspirin resulted in neither a lower risk of death or thrombotic complications nor a higher risk of bleeding than that with placebo.

"" Large randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of aspirin, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and statins as secondary prevention measures in patients after an acute coronary syndrome with and without ST elevations. Therefore we aimed to determine the effect of a combination therapy with these three drugs on 1-year mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).METHODS:  We prospectively followed 9998 survivors of acute myocardial infarction treated with a beta-blocker for 1 year. Patients were divided into three groups according to their therapy with aspirin, ACE inhibitors and statins: 3 drugs, 2 drugs or 0-1 drug.RESULTS:  The majority of patients (n = 6260, 62.6%) were treated with 3 drugs, 2986 (29.9%) with 2 drugs and 752 (7.5%) with 0-1 drug. In the univariate analysis 1-year mortality was 4.9%, 9.7% and 13.6%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors in the propensity score analysis the odds ratios for 1-year mortality were significantly increased with 0-1 drug (odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and with 2 drugs (odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.26-1.87) in comparison with the group treated with all 3 drugs. However, in the ACOS registry the treatment was left to the discretion of the physician. This could lead to a selection bias, which cannot be fully eliminated by using multiple regression analysis.S:  A combination therapy with aspirin, an ACE inhibitor and a statin reduces 1-year mortality in patients after AMI. Therefore a polypill approach with these three agents should be considered to increase drug compliance and reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction.
 Aspirin at 325 mg twice daily is now included as a nationally approved venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis protocol for low-risk total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is a difference in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurrence after a limited tourniquet TKA using aspirin-based prophylaxis with or without extended use of mechanical compression device (MCD) therapy.METHODS:  One hundred limited tourniquet TKA patients, whose DVT risk was managed with aspirin 325 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, were randomized to either using an MCD during hospitalization only or extended use at home up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Lower extremity duplex venous ultrasonography (LEDVU) was completed on the second postoperative day, 14 days postoperatively, and at 3 months postoperatively to confirm the absence of DVT after treatment.RESULTS:  The DVT rate for the postdischarge MCD therapy group was 0% and 23.1% for the inpatient MCD group (P < .001). All DVTs resolved by 3 months postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was 9.56 (±0.82) for postdischarge MCD patients vs 8.50 (±1.46) for inpatient MCD patients (P < .001).: "" Limited tourniquet TKA patients who were mobilized early, managed with aspirin for 3 weeks postoperatively, and on MCD therapy for up to 6 weeks postoperatively experienced superior DVT prophylaxis than patients receiving MCD therapy only as an inpatient (P < .05). The 0% incidence of nonsymptomatic DVTs prevented by aspirin and extended-use MCD further validates this type of prophylaxis in low DVT risk TKA patients.
 Low-dose aspirin (LDA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used concomitantly; however, some NSAIDs may interfere with LDA antiplatelet activity.: "" We evaluated the impact of coadministered enteric-coated naproxen 500 mg and immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg (fixed-dose combination) on LDA-mediated platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition.METHODS:  In this Phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy volunteers (50-75 years) received enteric-coated LDA 81 mg once daily (QD) on days 1 to 5 (open-label), then enteric-coated LDA 81 mg QD plus either naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium or placebo twice daily (BID) on days 6 to 10 (randomized). Serum thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) inhibition from baseline to day 11 was the primary end point. The primary analysis excluded volunteers with ≤95% inhibition at day 6. Assay sensitivity and noninferiority of naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium versus placebo were concluded if the 90% CI lower limit for percent inhibition of TXB(2) was >90.0% in both treatment groups (prespecified criterion). Tolerability was a secondary end point.RESULTS:  Overall, 42 volunteers were enrolled, 40 randomized, and 32 included in the primary pharmacodynamic analysis (day 6 TXB(2) inhibition ≥95%). Most volunteers (86%) were white, and 57% were female. Mean age was 60 (7) years, and mean body mass index was 26.4 (2.6) kg/m(2). Day 11 mean serum TXB(2) inhibition was 99.1% (90% CI, 98.7-99.6) in the LDA plus placebo group (n = 18) versus 99.6% (90% CI, 99.4-99.8) in the LDA plus naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium group (n = 14). Noninferiority of naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium versus placebo was established (CI lower limit >90.0%). Adverse event (AE) incidence was 40% (n = 8/20) in the LDA plus placebo group and 15% (n = 3/20) in the LDA plus naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium group. No serious AEs or discontinuations due to AEs were observed.
Aspirin modestly influences cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the reason is unclear. The aim of the study was to determine whether in T2DM patients aspirin enhances platelet isoprostanes, which are eicosanoids with proaggregating properties derived from arachidonic acid oxidation by platelet NOX2, the catalytic subunit of reduced NAD phosphate oxidase. A cross-sectional study was performed comparing T2DM patients, treated (n = 50) or not treated (n = 50) with 100 mg/day aspirin, with 100 nondiabetic patients, matched for age, sex, atherosclerosis risk factors, and aspirin treatment. A short-term (7 days) treatment with 100 mg/day aspirin also was performed in 36 aspirin-free diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Higher platelet recruitment, platelet isoprostane, and NOX2 activation was found in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients and in aspirin-treated diabetic patients versus nontreated patients (P < 0.001). Platelet thromboxane (Tx) A(2) (P < 0.001) was inhibited in all aspirin-treated patients. In the interventional study, aspirin similarly inhibited platelet TxA(2) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (P < 0.001). Platelet recruitment, isoprostane levels, and NOX2 activation showed a parallel increase in diabetic patients (P < 0.001) and no changes in nondiabetic patients. These findings suggest that in aspirin-treated diabetic patients, oxidative stress-mediated platelet isoprostane overproduction is associated with enhanced platelet recruitment, an effect that mitigates aspirin-mediated TxA(2) inhibition.
 Aspirin is an antiplatelet drug which is commonly used in secondary prevention in ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular events, and in newly diagnosed myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to examine effect of aspirin on the level of selected sphingolipid intermediates in plasma, erythrocytes and platelets.MATERIAL AND METHOD: "MATERIAL AND METHOD" Forty two healthy volunteers participated in the study. They were divided into two groups. In one group aspirin was given orally, daily, for one week in a dose of 75 mg (n=25). The subjects from the second group received one 300 mg dose of the drug (n=17). In both groups the blood was taken 4h after the last dose of aspirin. The following sphingolipid intermediates were quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography: sphinganine, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) and ceramide.RESULTS:  It was found that lower dose of aspirin increased the level of S1P and ceramide in erythrocytes (by 23 and 37%, respectively) having no effect on plasma and platelet sphingolipid levels. Higher dose of the drug reduced S1P and SA1P concentration in the plasma (by 16 and 10%, respectively).: "" We conclude that aspirin interferes with sphingolipid metabolism in blood and that this effect depends on a dose of the drug. Since S1P is a potent cardioprotectant, the reduction in its plasma concentration after the loading dose of aspirin could be undesired side effect of the drug.
 The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between time in the therapeutic range (TTR) and clinical outcomes in heart failure patients in sinus rhythm treated with warfarin.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We used data from the Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) trial to assess the relationship of TTR with the WARCEF primary outcome (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or death), with death alone, ischemic stroke alone, major hemorrhage alone, and net clinical benefit (primary outcome and major hemorrhage combined). Multivariable Cox models were used to examine how the event risk changed with TTR and to compare the high TTR, low TTR, and aspirin-treated patients, with TTR being treated as a time-dependent covariate. A total of 2217 patients were included in the analyses; among whom 1067 were randomized to warfarin and 1150 were randomized to aspirin. The median (interquartile range) follow-up duration was 3.6 (2.0-5.0) years. Mean (±SD) age was 61±11.3 years, with 80% being men. The mean (±SD) TTR was 57% (±28.5%). Increasing TTR was significantly associated with reduction in primary outcome (adjusted P<0.001), death alone (adjusted P=0.001), and improved net clinical benefit (adjusted P<0.001). A similar trend was observed for the other 2 outcomes, but significance was not reached (adjusted P=0.082 for ischemic stroke and adjusted P=0.109 for major hemorrhage).S:  In patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm, increasing TTR is associated with better outcome and improved net clinical benefit. Patients in whom good quality anticoagulation can be achieved may benefit from the use of anticoagulants.
 About 20% of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a recurrence within 2 years after the withdrawal of oral anticoagulant therapy. Extending anticoagulation prevents recurrences but is associated with increased bleeding. The benefit of aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism is unknown.METHODS:  In this multicenter, investigator-initiated, double-blind study, patients with first-ever unprovoked venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant treatment were randomly assigned to aspirin, 100 mg daily, or placebo for 2 years, with the option of extending the study treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.RESULTS:  Venous thromboembolism recurred in 28 of the 205 patients who received aspirin and in 43 of the 197 patients who received placebo (6.6% vs. 11.2% per year; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.93) (median study period, 24.6 months). During a median treatment period of 23.9 months, 23 patients taking aspirin and 39 taking placebo had a recurrence (5.9% vs. 11.0% per year; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.92). One patient in each treatment group had a major bleeding episode. Adverse events were similar in the two groups.
 Aspirin is promptly administered to patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. It is not known whether aspirin pretreatment in acute coronary syndrome patients is beneficial, particularly because some, but not all, prior studies identified aspirin pretreatment as an independent risk factor for adverse ischemic events.: "" To study the effect of aspirin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes enrolled in two large randomized clinical trials.METHODS:  Patients enrolled in the ACUITY and HORIZONS-AMI trials were analyzed according to aspirin pretreatment within 5-7 days before acute coronary syndromes. We evaluated the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis and bleeding at 30 days and 1 year. Multivariable regression analysis was performed for all-cause and cardiac death.RESULTS:  Among 17,387 patients, 10,587 (60.9%) were pretreated with aspirin. Pretreated patients were significantly older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior revascularization, and receive only medical therapy without revascularization. Aspirin pretreatment was associated with reduced 48-hour cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.97; P=0.04) and 30-day death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.94; P=0.04). Myocardial infarction was more frequent in the aspirin pretreatment group at 30 days (P<0.0001), while stent thrombosis was less frequent (P=0.01). A strong interaction was present such that aspirin pretreatment was associated with reduced 30-day death in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), but not in those with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (P=0.001).S:  Among patients with acute coronary syndromes in these two large prospective studies, aspirin pretreatment identified a higher risk cohort and was an independent predictor of reduced mortality at 30 days, especially in patients with NSTEACS.
 It remains unclear whether concomitant use of omeprazole attenuates platelet function as compared with that of famotidine in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who receive clopidogrel.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" In this prospective study, 130 ACS patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel who underwent stent implantation were randomly assigned to receive a Japanese standard dose of omeprazole 10mg daily or famotidine 20mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Between 14 and 28 days after enrollment, there was no significant difference in the platelet reactivity index (PRI) measured with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay between the omeprazole group (n=65) and famotidine group (n=65) (55±17% vs. 51±19%; P=0.26). The cumulative rate of adverse cardiovascular events at 12 months was similar in the groups (13% vs. 17%; P=0.81). The PRI was similar (54.9±17.9% vs. 54.0±17.8%; P=0.83) in the omeprazole group (n=33) and the famotidine group (n=39) among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, there was a trend toward a higher PRI (55.2±15.9% vs. 46.4±19.4%; P=0.06) in the omeprazole group (n=32) as compared with the famotidine group (n=26) among patients without persistent ST-segment elevation ACS.S:  As compared with famotidine, concomitant use of low-dose omeprazole does not significantly attenuate the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel in patients with ACS, especially in those with STEMI.
"S" The goal of this study was to investigate the differential efficacy of clopidogrel or aspirin monotherapy according to smoking status in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease.BACKGROUND:  Smoking enhances clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition, which may explain the higher relative benefit among smokers observed in trials evaluating dual antiplatelet therapy. Whether smoking has an impact on clinical outcomes in patients requiring a single antiplatelet agent remains unknown.METHODS:  This was a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trial that compared clopidogrel and aspirin monotherapy in patients (N = 19,184) with atherosclerotic vascular disease.RESULTS:  Current smokers (n = 5,688) had an increased risk of ischemic events compared with never smokers (n = 4,135; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08 to 1.42]) and ex-smokers (n = 9,381; HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.18 to 1.47]) (p < 0.001). Clopidogrel was associated with a reduction in ischemic events among current smokers (8.3% vs. 10.8%; HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90]), whereas no benefit over aspirin was seen in the combined group of ex-smokers/never-smoked patients (10.4% vs. 10.6%; HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.89 to 1.10]; p = 0.01 for interaction). Among current smokers, clopidogrel also reduced myocardial infarction, vascular death, and death from any cause compared with aspirin. No interaction between smoking status and study treatment was observed for bleeding events.S:  In a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE population, current smokers appeared to have enhanced benefit with clopidogrel therapy for secondary prevention compared with aspirin. These results should be considered hypothesis generating for future prospective studies assessing the impact of specific platelet-inhibiting strategies according to smoking status.
 The use of selective cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitors as an alternative to aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been suggested for patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).: "" To evaluate tolerability to etoricoxib, a second-generation COX-2 inhibitor with high in vitro selectivity for COX-2 in patients with AERD.METHODS:  We conducted a retrospective review of patients with suspected aspirin intolerance seen between October 2007 and April 2012. Single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with increasing doses of aspirin and etoricoxib were performed on 3 different days.RESULTS:  Of 262 patients with suspected aspirin intolerance, 248 underwent challenge testing with aspirin and 122 (49.2%) showed positive test results. In 104 of these aspirin-sensitive patients, etoricoxib was tested as an alternative drug and was tolerated in all but 3 (2.9%), who developed a positive asthmatic reaction.S:  The highly selective COX-2 inhibitor etoricoxib was tolerated in most but not all patients tested. An oral provocation test is therefore recommended before prescribing etoricoxib for patients with AERD.
 Systemic reactions are related to the pathogenesis of Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD). With this work we wanted to study the changes in the systemic levels of inflammatory mediators in both baseline and after oral aspirin challenge in patients with and without AERD.METHODS:  Patients with nasal polyposis and asthma with AERD (n=20) and without (n=18) were orally challenged with aspirin in a single-blind placebo controlled study. Serum samples and urine were collected before and 6h after placebo and aspirin oral challenges. Serum levels of inflammatory mediators were assayed by using the Luminex technology and ELISA. The concentrations of 9-alpha, 11-beta prostaglandin F2, and leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) were measured in urine samples by ELISA. The expression of T-cell surface markers was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated before and after the challenges.RESULTS:  AERD patients showed significantly higher baseline levels of s-IL-5R-alpha, uLTE4 and percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(pos) and CD4(+)CD45RA(-)CD45RO(+) but decreased levels of TGF-β1 and number of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(neg) cells. Aspirin challenge induced the release of uLTE4, IL-6 and increased the number of CD4(+)CD45RA(-)CD45RO(+) memory T-cells only in AERD patients but failed to reduce the levels of sCD40L as observed in non-AERD subjects. Further, IL-8 and sIL-5R-alpha levels directly correlated with the PD20ASA and the effects of aspirin on IL-6 and number of memory T-cells was more pronounced in subjects showing more strong reaction (bronchial and nasal).S:  AERD patients have a differential baseline inflammatory pattern that supports the role inflammation as underlying mechanism of the disease. Systemic response to oral aspirin challenge was related to an increase in serum IL-6 and the number of circulating memory T-cells in AERD patients.
"" To study the effect of aspirin in the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk women.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.SETTING: "SETTING" Maternity clinics in ten Finnish hospitals participating in the PREDO Project.SAMPLE: "SAMPLE" A total of 152 women with risk factors for pre-eclampsia and abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry.METHODS:  Participants were randomised to start either aspirin 100 mg/day or placebo at 12 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks + days of gestation. Because of the limited power of this trial, we also conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that included data on 346 women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler flow velocimetry, and aspirin 50-150 mg/day started at or before 16( ) weeks of gestation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE" Pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and birthweight standard deviation (SD) score. Outcome measures for the meta-analysis were pre-eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia, preterm (diagnosed <37 + 0 weeks of gestation) and term pre-eclampsia.RESULTS:  From the 152 randomised women, 121 were included in the final analysis. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce the rate of pre-eclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.7); gestational hypertension (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6-4.2); early-onset pre-eclampsia (diagnosed <34 + 0 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.03-2.1); or severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.3); and the results were not statistically significant in an intention-to-treat analysis. However, our meta-analysis, including the current data, suggested that low-dose aspirin initiated before 16 weeks of gestation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) and severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7).S:  Our trial showed no statistically significant effect of aspirin in preventing pre-eclampsia in high-risk women. However, our meta-analysis suggested that aspirin may reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia.
Epidemiologic studies suggest a reduced risk of breast cancer among women who use aspirin. A plausible mechanism is through aspirin's effect on estrogens, possibly mediated through interference with estrogen synthesis via reduction in inflammation, which is increased in adipose tissues, including breast. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of six-month administration of 325 mg/day aspirin on serum estrogens (estradiol, estrone, free estradiol, and bioavailable estradiol) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in 144 healthy postmenopausal women. Eligible participants, recruited 2005-2007, were not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, including aspirin >2 times/week or menopausal hormone therapy, and had a Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic density classification of 2, 3, or 4. The intervention effects (intent-to-treat) were evaluated by differences in the geometric mean outcome changes at six months between aspirin and placebo groups using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Participants were a mean 59.4 (SD, 5.4) years of age, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.4 (SD, 5.4) kg/m(2). Between baseline and six months, none of the serum estrogens or SHBG changed substantially and there were no differences between groups. Stratifying by BMI did not change results. In conclusion, a single daily administration of 325 mg of aspirin for six months had no effect on serum estrogens or SHBG in postmenopausal women. Larger doses or longer duration of aspirin administration may be needed to affect circulating estrogens. Alternately, if aspirin influences breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, it may do so through direct breast tissue effects, or through pathways other than estrogens.
 Aspirin is widely used in the secondary prevention of coronary artery diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular related deaths. However, the antiplatelet effect of aspirin appears to be variable and aspirin resistance (AR) is currently still controversial for Chinese patients. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of AR, and identify possible risk factors associated with a lack of response to aspirin treatments in patients with unstable coronary artery disease.METHODS:  Platelet function tests with arachidonic acid (ARA) and urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (11-DH-TXB2) concentrations were performed in 262 patients with unstable coronary artery disease who had not been taking aspirin before admission. ARA induced platelet aggregation and 11-DH-TXB2 were detected to evaluate the functional and biochemical responses to aspirin before and on days 1, 4, and 10 after aspirin administration. Six-month follow-up was completed in patients who developed AR to evaluate the effect of aspirin in a long-term treatment. GP1Bα (C1018T), Pl (A1/A2), P2Y1 (A1622G), TBXA2R (T924C) were also detected to evaluate the influence of genetic variant on aspirin responsiveness.RESULTS:  A total of 8.8% of patients were indentified as AR at the first day after aspirin treatment. The level of urine 11-DH-TXB2 in the AR group was higher compared to non-AR group (P < 0.05). There was no relationship between ARA induced platelet aggregation and urinary 11-DH-TXB2 levels (r = 0.038, P = 0.412). The results of DNA sequencing showed that TBXA2R-924TT homozygotes had a significantly high rate of AR. Logistic regression demonstrated that diabetes was an independent risk factor of AR.S:  In the beginning period of administration, aspirin was not a sufficient factor that inhibits platelet aggregation. TBXA2R-924T allele was involved in AR. Diabetes was an independent risk factor of AR.
 Based on animal and human data, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)β is a promising antithrombotic target. However, the relation between efficacy and bleeding when combined with current antiplatelet therapies is unclear.: "" To strengthen the PI3Kβ target validation using the short-acting inhibitor AZD6482 alone and in different combinations with P2Y12 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition in vitro (human platelets), in vivo (dog), and in healthy subjects.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" Evaluation of complete target inhibition of PI3Kβ (by AZD6482), P2Y12 (by ticagrelor), and COX-1 (by aspirin) alone and in the different combinations vs. concentration responses for a panel of platelet agonists in vitro (adenosine diphosphate, collagen, thrombin receptor activating peptide) indicates that the rank order of antiplatelet efficacy is P2Y12  > PI3Kβ > COX-1 as monotherapy and P2Y12 plus PI3Kβ > P2Y12 plus COX-1 > PI3Kβ plus COX-1 as dual therapy, with little additional effect with triple therapy. Use of a conscious dog model to assess ex vivo antiplatelet effect in parallel with bleeding time prolongation (standard incision in the ear) confirms the wide separation of efficacy vs. bleeding for PI3Kβ inhibition and that this separation is reduced when combined with aspirin and more reduced when combined with clopidogrel. In healthy subjects, AZD6482, in combination with aspirin, shows a potential for greater antiplatelet potency but less bleeding potential compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin.S:  PI3Kβ inhibition, in comparison with P2Y12 and COX-1, delivers medium antiplatelet effect but with minimal bleeding. PI3Kβ inhibition, in combination with aspirin, in healthy subjects, provides a potential for greater overall antiplatelet effect compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin, but with significantly less bleeding potential.
 The COGENT (Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial) showed that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) safely reduced rates of gastrointestinal (GI) events in patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). However, utilization of appropriate prophylactic PPI therapy remains suboptimal, especially with low-dose aspirin.S: "S" The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of PPI therapy in patients receiving DAPT in low- and high-dose aspirin subsets.METHODS:  Randomized patients with available aspirin dosing information in COGENT (N = 3,752) were divided into "low-dose" (≤ 100 mg) and "high-dose" (>100 mg) aspirin groups. The primary GI and cardiovascular endpoints were composite upper GI events and major adverse cardiac events, respectively. All events were adjudicated by independent, blinded gastroenterologists and cardiologists.RESULTS:  Median duration of follow-up was 110 days. Low-dose aspirin users (n = 2,480; 66.1%) were more likely to be older, female, and have higher rates of peripheral artery disease, prior stroke, and hypertension, whereas high-dose aspirin users (n = 1,272; 33.9%) had higher rates of hyperlipidemia, smoking, a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, and were more than twice as likely to be enrolled from sites within the United States (80.4% vs. 39.8%). High-dose aspirin was associated with similar 180-day Kaplan-Meier estimates of adjudicated composite GI events (1.7% vs. 2.1%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 1.66) and major adverse cardiac events (4.8% vs. 5.5%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 1.11) compared with low-dose aspirin. Randomization to PPI therapy reduced 180-day Kaplan-Meier estimates of the primary GI endpoint in low-dose (1.2% vs. 3.1%) and high-dose aspirin subsets (0.9% vs. 2.6%; p for interaction = 0.80), and did not adversely affect the primary cardiovascular endpoint in either group.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Apixaban reduces stroke with comparable bleeding risks when compared with aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation who are unsuitable for vitamin k antagonist therapy. This analysis explores patterns of bleeding and defines bleeding risks based on stroke risk with apixaban and aspirin.METHODS:  The Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin k Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial randomized 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation and risk factors to receive either apixaban or aspirin. Bleeding events were defined as the first occurrence of either major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.RESULTS:  The rate of a bleeding event was 3.8%/year with aspirin and 4.5%/year with apixaban (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.92-1.51; P=0.19). The anatomic site of bleeding did not differ between therapies. Risk factors for bleeding common to apixaban and aspirin were use of nonstudy aspirin>50% of the time and a history of daily/occasional nosebleeds. The rates of both stroke and bleeding increased with higher CHADS2 scores but apixaban compared with aspirin was associated with a similar relative risk of bleeding (P interaction 0.21) and a reduced relative risk of stroke (P interaction 0.37) irrespective of CHADS2 category.
"AIM" The aim of this study was to determine the effect of low-dose aspirin on venous leg ulcer healing when used in addition to compression.BACKGROUND:  The mainstay of treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy and there are few adjuvant treatments to accelerate healing.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Pragmatic, community-based, double-blind, randomized trial.METHODS:  Participants with venous leg ulcers will receive either 150 mg aspirin or placebo daily for up to 24 weeks. Participants will receive background treatment with compression therapy (system of choice guided by participant and/or clinical preference) delivered through district nursing services. The primary outcome will be time-to-healing. Secondary outcomes will include proportion healed at 24 weeks, change in ulcer area, change in health-related quality of life, adherence, efficacy of blinding and adverse events. The trial was funded in June 2014.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" The trial commenced in March 2015 and is successfully recruiting. The trial is one of three trials that will contribute to an individual participant data meta-analysis to be undertaken at the York Trials Centre.
Thrombotic events while receiving antiplatelet agents (APAs) are more common in subjects with versus without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data on antiplatelet effects of APA in CKD are scarce and limited by lack of baseline platelet function before APA treatment. We hypothesized subjects with stages 4 to 5 CKD versus no CKD have greater baseline platelet aggregability and respond poorly to aspirin and clopidogrel. In a prospective controlled study, we measured whole blood platelet aggregation (WBPA) in 28 CKD and 16 non-CKD asymptomatic stable outpatients not on APA, frequency-matched for age, gender, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. WBPA was remeasured after 2 weeks of each aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel. The primary outcome was percent inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) from baseline. The secondary outcome was residual platelet aggregability (RPA; proportion with <50% IPA). Baseline platelet aggregability was similar between groups except adenosine diphosphate-induced WBPA, which was higher in CKD versus non-CKD; median (interquartile range) = 13.5 (9.5 to 16.0) versus 9.0 (6.0 to 12.0) Ω, p = 0.007. CKD versus non-CKD participants had lower clopidogrel-induced IPA, 38% versus 72%, p = 0.04. A greater proportion of CKD versus non-CKD participants had RPA after clopidogrel treatment (56% vs 8.3%, p = 0.01). There were no significant interactions between CKD and the presence of cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphisms for platelet aggregability in clopidogrel-treated participants. In conclusion, CKD versus non-CKD subjects exhibited similar platelet aggregation at baseline, similar aspirin effects and greater RPA on clopidogrel, which was independent of cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphisms.
 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is necessary to prevent thrombosis yet increases bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). Antiplatelet monotherapy with a potent P2Y<sub12</sub receptor antagonist may reduce bleeding while maintaining anti thrombotic efficacy compared with conventional DAPT.METHODS:  TWILIGHT is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the comparative efficacy and safety of antiplatelet monotherapy versus DAPT in up to 9000 high-risk patients undergoing PCI with DES. Upon enrollment after successful PCI, all patients will be treated with open label low-dose aspirin (81-100 mg daily) plus ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) for 3 months. Event-free patients will then be randomized in a double-blind fashion to low-dose aspirin versus matching placebo with continuation of open-label ticagrelor for an additional 12 months. The primary hypothesis is that a strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy will be superior with respect to the primary endpoint of bleeding academic research consortium type 2, 3 or 5, while maintaining non-inferiority for ischemic events compared with ticagrelor plus ASA.S:  TWILIGHT is the largest study to date that is specifically designed and powered to demonstrate reductions in bleeding with ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor plus ASA beyond 3 months post-procedure in a high-risk PCI population treated with DES. The trial will provide novel insights with respect to the potential role of ticagrelor monotherapy as an alternative for long-term platelet inhibition in a broad population of patients undergoing PCI with DES.
"" Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is comprised of aspirin/acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) sensitivity, bronchial asthma, and nasal polyposis. Treatment of this condition is challenging and may include topical/systemic steroids, endoscopic sinus surgery, and/or aspirin desensitization.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" A prospective crossover pilot study (n = 10) was conducted in which patients were randomized into either of 2 groups with 6 weeks of regular diet (R) or 6 weeks of a low salicylate diet (LS).SETTING: "SETTING" The study was conducted in a tertiary otolaryngology clinic.SUBJECTS: "SUBJECTS" Patients with AERD were enrolled in the study.METHODS:  Subjective (Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 [SNOT-22], Nasal Sinus Symptom Scale [NSSS], and the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 [ACQ-7]) and objective outcome instruments (Peri-Operative Sinus Evaluation [POSE] and Lund-Kennedy Endoscopic Score [LKES]) were used to evaluate patients at baseline, 6 weeks (at crossover), and 12 weeks.RESULTS:  Wilcoxon rank sum tests demonstrated that patients on the low salicylate diet had improved scores compared to their regular diet when evaluated by 4 of the 5 outcome measures (SNOT-22 pLS = 0.0059, NSSS pLS = 0.0195, LKES pLS = 0.0039, POSE pLS = 0.005).: "" Results of the pilot study indicate that implementation of a low salicylate diet improves the nasal symptoms and nasal endoscopy findings of individuals with AERD. Further research is required to support these findings.
 Previous studies have suggested that pre-stroke treatment with low-dose aspirin (A) could reduce the severity of acute ischaemic stroke, but less is known on the effect of pre-stroke treatment with a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole (A + D) and post-stroke effects of these drugs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of this drug combination on acute and long-term prognosis of ischaemic stroke.METHODS:  Patients without atrial fibrillation admitted to the stroke unit with acute ischaemic stroke (n = 554) or TIA (n = 108) were studied during acute hospital care and up to 12 months after discharge from hospital.RESULTS:  Prior to acute stroke 62 patients were treated with A + D while 247 patients were treated with A only. No beneficial effects of the combination A + D compared to A only were noted on stroke severity and/or acute in-hospital mortality. However, survival analysis by Cox-proportional hazard model demonstrated lower 12-months all-cause mortality in patients discharged with A + D (n = 275) compared with patients on A only (HR, 0.52; CI, 0.32-0.86; p = 0.011; n = 262) after adjusting for age, baseline NIHSS, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes. We also noted a tendency towards lower all-cause mortality at 3 months with use of A + D, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.12).S:  Pre-stroke treatment with a combination of low-dose A + D does not reduce the severity of acute stroke, nor does it reduce the acute in-hospital mortality. However, treatment with A + D at discharge from hospital is seemingly associated with lower long-term mortality compared with A only, contrary to the results from previous randomised studies. However, our results must be interpreted with extreme caution considering the non-randomised study design.
"AIMS" The objective of the present substudy was to examine whether aspirin poor/high responsiveness (APR/AHR) is associated with increased rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and serious bleeding after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).METHODS:  We analyzed 961 consecutive ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction patients who underwent PPCI between February 2008 and June 2011. Multiplate analyser (Dynabite, Munich, Germany) was used for the assessment of platelet reactivity. APR/AHR were defined as the upper/lower quintiles of ASPI values, determined 24 h after aspirin loading. APR patients were tailored using 300 mg maintenance dose for 30 days. The co-primary end points at 30 days were: MACE (death, non-fatal infarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization and ischemic stroke) and serious bleeding according to the BARC classification.RESULTS:  One hundred and 90 patients were classified as APR, and 193 patients as AHR. At admission, compared with aspirin sensitive patients (ASP), patients with APR had more frequently diabetes, anterior infarction and heart failure, while AHR patients had reduced values of creatine kinase, leukocytes, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Compared with ASP, the rates of 30-day primary end points did not differ neither in APR group including tailored patients (MACE, adjusted OR 1.02, 95%CI 0.47-2.17; serious bleeding, adjusted OR 1.92, 95%CI 0.79-4.63), nor in patients with AHR (MACE, adjusted OR 1.58, 95%CI 0.71-5.51; serious bleeding, adjusted OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.22-2.12).S:  The majority of APR patients were suitable for tailoring. Neither APR including tailored patients nor AHR were associated with adverse 30-day efficacy or safety clinical outcomes.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Atrial fibrillation is associated with decline of cognitive function. Observational evidence suggests that anticoagulation might protect against this decline. We report the first randomized controlled trial evidence on the effect of anticoagulation on cognitive function in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation.METHODS:  A total of 973 patients aged≥75 years with atrial fibrillation were recruited from primary care and randomly assigned to warfarin (n=488; target international normalized ratio, 2-3) or aspirin (n=485; 75 mg/d). Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group assignment. Follow-up was for a mean of 2.7 years (SD, 1.2). Cognitive outcome was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination at 9-, 21-, and 33-month follow-up. Participants who had a stroke were censored from the analysis, which was by intention to treat with imputation for missing data.RESULTS:  There was no difference between mean Mini-Mental State Examination scores in people assigned to warfarin or aspirin at 9 or 21 months. At 33-month follow-up, there was a nonsignificant difference of 0.56 in favor of warfarin that decreased to 0.49 (95% confidence interval, -0.01 to 0.98) after imputation.S:  We found no evidence that anticoagulation confers clinically important protection over aspirin against cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination in atrial fibrillation in the first 33 months of treatment other than that provided by preventing clinical stroke.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: "CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL" http://www.controlled-trials.com. Unique identifier: ISRCTN89345269.
 increasing age is associated with a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), and higher risks of stroke and bleeding. We report the effects of apixaban versus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in older patients (≥75 years and ≥85 years) compared with younger patients with AF unsuitable for vitamin K antagonists.METHODS:  AVERROES (Apixaban Versus ASA to Prevent Stroke In AF Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) trial (n = 5,599) included 1,898 patients ≥75 years and 366 patients ≥85 years. We compared the baseline characteristics and effects of apixaban compared with aspirin on clinical outcomes by age.RESULTS:  compared with aspirin, apixaban was more efficacious for preventing strokes and systemic embolism in patients ≥85 years (absolute rate [AR] 1%/year on apixaban versus 7.5%/year on aspirin; hazard ratio [HR] 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.48) compared with younger patients (AR 1.7%/year on apixaban versus 3.4%/year on aspirin; HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.69) (P-value for interaction = 0.05). Major haemorrhage was higher in patients ≥85 years compared with younger patients but similar with apixaban versus aspirin in both young and older individuals (4.9%/year versus 1.0%/year on aspirin and 4.7%/year versus 1.2%/year on apixaban) with no significant treatment-by-age interaction (P-value = 0.65).S:  older patients with AF are at particularly high risk of stroke if given aspirin and have substantially greater relative and absolute benefits from apixaban compared with younger patients with no greater risk of haemorrhage.
 Ticagrelor may be a more effective antiplatelet therapy than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.METHODS:  We conducted an international double-blind, controlled trial in 674 centers in 33 countries, in which 13,199 patients with a nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack who had not received intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have had a cardioembolic stroke were randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90). The primary end point was the time to the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days.RESULTS:  During the 90 days of treatment, a primary end-point event occurred in 442 of the 6589 patients (6.7%) treated with ticagrelor, versus 497 of the 6610 patients (7.5%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.01; P=0.07). Ischemic stroke occurred in 385 patients (5.8%) treated with ticagrelor and in 441 patients (6.7%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00). Major bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with ticagrelor and in 0.6% of patients treated with aspirin, intracranial hemorrhage in 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, and fatal bleeding in 0.1% and 0.1%.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a particularly high risk for ischemic and bleeding events. Limited data exist as to the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in stroke patients with renal dysfunction. Therefore, we sought to assess the impact of decreased kidney function on clinical outcomes for stroke patients on clopidogrel-aspirin treatment.METHODS:  Patients in the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin-alone treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke during 90 days, whereas bleeding was the safety outcome. Patients were stratified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate.RESULTS:  Dual clopidogrel-aspirin therapy was associated with a marked reduction in new strokes compared with the therapy of aspirin alone in patients with normal renal function (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.98; P=0.02) and mild CKD (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.79; P<0.01), whereas in patients with moderate CKD, no significant benefit from clopidogrel therapy was detected (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.35; P=0.99). There was no clear difference in bleeding episodes by treatment assignment across categories of renal impairment.S:  Clopidogrel plus aspirin could decrease new stroke in patients with normal kidney function and mild CKD, but no extra benefit was observed in those with moderate CKD. Bleeding risk from the dual therapy did not seem to increase in mild or moderate CKD patients.
"" To examine whether combined treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and aspirin reduces recurrent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HD: pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome) in women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) and a previous delivery for HD and/or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birthweight before 34 weeks gestation.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" This multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed between December 2000 and December 2009. Women were recruited from all eight university and six non-university/teaching hospitals in The Netherlands, two university hospitals in Australia and one university hospital in Sweden. Thirty two women with a previous delivery <34 weeks gestation with HD and/or SGA and aPLA were included before 12 weeks gestation. The intervention was daily LMWH with aspirin or aspirin alone.PRIMARY OUTCOMES: "PRIMARY OUTCOMES" recurrent HD onset <34 weeks and recurrent HD irrespective of gestational age. Analysis by intention-to-treat.RESULTS:  After an interim analysis, recruitment was ceased: accrual was low and the incidence of recurrent HD was far lower (3%) than expected (60%). The final analysis, performed on 32 women, shows no difference in the primary outcomes (LMWH and aspirin 0/16 versus aspirin only 1/16, risk difference 6.25% [CI -17 to 27%] for recurrent HD onset <34 weeks and 0/16 for LMWH and aspirin versus 2/16 for aspirin only, risk difference 12.5% [CI -15 to 35%] for HD irrespective of gestational age).: "" In this population of women with aPLA, who had previously had an early delivery for HD and/or SGA prior to 34 weeks gestation, combined LMWH and aspirin treatment started before 12 weeks gestation in a subsequent pregnancy did not show reduction of onset of recurrent HD either <34 weeks gestation or irrespective of gestational age, compared with aspirin alone.
 Primary vascular dysregulation (PVD) is a condition in which the response to cold temperature or external stimuli is abnormal. We investigated whether triflusal use results in amelioration of PVD symptoms and improvement of several related parameters compared with aspirin.: "" Eighty-eight PVD patients (54% female, 56±8 years) were randomly selected to receive either triflusal (300 mg, b.i.d.) or aspirin (150 mg, b.i.d.) for a period of 6 weeks followed by crossover. PVD was defined as both red-blood-cell standstill in video-assisted microscopic capillaroscopy during cold stimulation using carbon dioxide gas and a score of more than 7 points in a validated questionnaire. Efficacy of treatment was assessed by 1) cold intolerance symptom severity (CISS) score, 2) finger Doppler indices, and 3) indocyanine green perfusion imaging.RESULTS:  The use of triflusal resulted in a greater improvement in CISS score (44.5±18.4 vs. 51.9±16.2; p<0.001) and in mean radial peak systolic velocity (69.8±17.2 vs. 66.1±16.4; p=0.011) compared to aspirin. Furthermore, significant differences were also observed in perfusion rates on indocyanine green perfusion imaging between triflusal and aspirin (45.6±25.8 vs. 51.6±26.9; p=0.020).: "" Triflusal was more effective and demonstrated a more consistent impact on the improvement of symptoms and blood flow in patients with PVD than aspirin.
"S" The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and amantadine for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS).METHODS:  A 10-week, randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial conducted from October  2009 to September 2010. Fifty-two patients with MS presenting fatigue at 21 to 53 years of age were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups. The first group received amantadine (100 mg twice daily) for a total of 4 weeks. The second group received ASA (500 mg once daily) for four weeks.  After a 2-week washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 4 weeks. Patients were rated at baseline and the end of each phase with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).RESULTS:  ASA appeared to be equivalent in efficacy and safety to amantadine. A significant decrease  in FSS occurred in both groups. Of the 26 patients treated with amantadine, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4·8 (1·4) to 4·0 (1·4) (P<0·001). In the 26 patients treated with ASA, the mean (SD) of FSS decreased from 4·6 (1·4) to  3·5 (1·5) (P<0·001).DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This study demonstrates that both ASA and amantadine significantly reduce MS-related fatigue. Both ASA and amantadine have previously been shown to reduce fatigue, and we postulate that treatment with ASA and amantadine  may have similar benefits.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Although recommended by guidelines, the benefits of treating patients with atrial fibrillation with a low-stroke risk score, with aspirin or anticoagulants, have not been clearly established. With advent of safer non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, we assessed the clinical and economic implications of 5 mg BID of apixaban versus aspirin among patients with a relative low risk of stroke as assessed using the CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age>75, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease) stroke risk classification.METHODS:  A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted. A secondary analysis of the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) study was conducted to estimate event rates in different low-risk cohorts by treatment. Three cohorts (n=1000) with a CHADS2 score of 1, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, and CHA2DS2-VASc of score 2 to 4 were simulated to assess the number of clinical events avoided in terms of strokes and major bleeds, as well as life years gained, quality-adjusted life years gained, costs, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained.RESULTS:  Apixaban was associated with fewer strokes and systemic embolism versus aspirin across all subgroups; however, it caused more major bleeding events. The reduction in systemic embolism offset the increase in major bleeding events leading to increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life year gains, achieved at an increased cost that was lower than the UK threshold of $44,400 (ie, £30,000) per quality-adjusted life year gained across the 3 cohorts examined.S:  Anticoagulant treatment with apixaban versus aspirin in low-risk patients, as identified using CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc, is projected to increase life expectancy and provide clinical benefits that are cost effective.
Interindividual variation in the ability of aspirin to inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) could account for some on-treatment cardiovascular events. Here, we sought to determine whether there are clinical phenotypes that are associated with a suboptimal pharmacological effect of aspirin. In a prospective, 2-week study, we evaluated the effect of aspirin (81 mg) on platelet COX-1 in 135 patients with stable coronary artery disease by measuring serum thromboxane B(2) (sTxB(2)) as an indicator of inhibition of platelet COX-1. A nested randomized study compared enteric-coated with immediate-release formulations of aspirin. We found that sTxB(2) was systematically higher among the 83 patients with metabolic syndrome than among the 52 patients without (median: 4.0 versus 3.02 ng/mL; P=0.013). Twelve patients (14%) with metabolic syndrome, but none without metabolic syndrome, had sTxB(2) levels consistent with inadequate inhibition of COX (sTxB(2) ≥13 ng/mL). In linear regression models, metabolic syndrome (but none of its individual components) significantly associated with higher levels of log-transformed sTxB(2) (P=0.006). Higher levels of sTxB(2) associated with greater residual platelet function measured by aggregometry-based methods. Among the randomized subset, sTxB(2) levels were systematically higher among patients receiving enteric-coated aspirin. Last, urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) did not correlate with sTxB(2), suggesting that the former should not be used to quantitate aspirin's pharmacological effect on platelets. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome, which places patients at high risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events, strongly and uniquely associates with less effective inhibition of platelet COX-1 by aspirin.
Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have increased propensity to generate thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and other eicosanoids which can contribute to their heightened platelet reactivity. EV-077 is a potent thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor and thus represents an attractive therapy in patients with DM. However, the effects of EV-077 on pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles in patients with DM and coronary artery disease (CAD) while on antiplatelet therapy is poorly explored and represented the aim of this in vitro pilot investigation. Patients with DM and stable CAD (n = 10) on low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) were enrolled and then switched to clopidogrel (75 mg/day) monotherapy for 7-10 days. PD assessments were conducted while on aspirin and on clopidogrel using light transmittance aggregometry following stimuli with U-46619 [TXA2 stable analogue (7 μM)], arachidonic acid [AA (1 mM)], collagen (3 μg/mL) and adenosine diphosphate [ADP (5 μM and 20 μM)] with and without in vitro EV-077. EV-077 completely inhibited U-46619-stimulated platelet aggregation (p = 0.005 for both aspirin and clopidogrel) and also showed a significant reduction of collagen-induced aggregation (aspirin p = 0.008; clopidogrel p = 0.005). EV-077 significantly reduced AA-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel (p = 0.009), but not aspirin (p = 0.667) treated patients. Ultimately, EV-077 significantly reduced ADP-mediated platelet aggregation in both aspirin (ADP 5 μM p = 0.012; ADP 20 μM p = 0.032) and clopidogrel (ADP 5 μM p = 0.007; ADP 20 μM p = 0.008) treated patients. In conclusion, in DM patients with CAD on aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, in vitro EV-077 exerts potent platelet inhibitory effects on multiple platelet signaling pathways. These data support that EV-077 has only additive platelet inhibiting effects on top of standard antiplatelet therapies. These findings warrant further investigation in ex vivo settings. 
Thrombin Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction in Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRACER) trial compared vorapaxar and placebo in 12,944 high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. We explored aspirin (ASA) use and its association with outcomes. Kaplan-Meier event rates were compared in groups defined by ASA dose (low, medium, and high). Landmark analyses with covariate adjustment were performed for 0 to 30, 31 to 180, and 181 to 365 days. Of 12,515 participants, 7,523, 1,049, and 3,943 participants were treated with low-, medium-, and high-dose ASA at baseline, respectively. Participants enrolled in North America versus elsewhere were more often treated with a high dose at baseline (66% vs 19%) and discharge (60% vs 3%). Unadjusted cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for ischemia, or urgent revascularization event rates tended to be higher with higher baseline ASA (18.45% low, 19.13% medium, and 20.27% high; p for trend = 0.15573). Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for effect of vorapaxar on cardiovascular (unadjusted p for interaction = 0.065; adjusted p for interaction = 0.140) and bleeding (unadjusted p for interaction = 0.915; adjusted p for interaction = 0.954) outcomes were similar across groups. Landmark analyses showed similar safety and efficacy outcomes with vorapaxar and placebo by ASA dose at each time point except for 0 to 30 days, when vorapaxar tended to be worse for efficacy (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.44, p for interaction = 0.0157). In conclusion, most TRACER participants were treated with low-dose ASA, although a high dose was common in North America. High-dose participants tended to have higher rates of ischemic and bleeding outcomes. Although formal statistical testing did not reveal heterogeneity in vorapaxar's effect across dose subgroups, consistent trends support use of low-dose ASA with other antiplatelet therapies.
"AIMS" The pattern of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrence-paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent-is associated with progressive stages of atrial dysfunction and structural changes and may therefore be associated with progressively higher stroke risk. However, previous studies have not consistently shown AF pattern to predict stroke but have been hampered by methodological shortcomings of low power, variable event ascertainment, and variable anticoagulant use.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We analysed the rates of stroke and systemic embolism in 6563 aspirin-treated patients with AF from the ACTIVE-A/AVERROES databases. There was thorough searching for events and adjudication. Multivariable analyses were performed with the adjustment for known risk factors for stroke. Mean age of patients with paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF was 69.0 ± 9.9, 68.6 ± 10.2, and 71.9 ± 9.8 years (P < 0.001). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was similar in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF (3.1 ± 1.4), but was higher in patients with permanent AF (3.6 ± 1.5, P < 0.001). Yearly ischaemic stroke rates were 2.1, 3.0, and 4.2% for paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF, respectively, with adjusted hazard ratio of 1.83 (P < 0.001) for permanent vs. paroxysmal and 1.44 (P = 0.02) for persistent vs. paroxysmal. Multivariable analysis identified age ≥ 75 year, sex, history of stroke or TIA, and AF pattern as independent predictors of stroke, with AF pattern being the second strongest predictor after prior stroke or TIA.: "" In a large population of non-anticoagulated AF patients, pattern of AF was a strong independent predictor of stroke risk and may be helpful to assess the risk/benefit for anticoagulant therapy, especially in lower risk patients.
 Patients with established coronary artery disease are at increased risk for future ischemic events and require secondary prevention for systemic vascular disease. We performed a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of cilostazol on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.METHODS:  A total of 514 patients who had undergone coronary stent implantation >6 months previously and were thought to no longer need dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine were randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus cilostazol therapy or aspirin therapy alone after discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular revascularization at 2 years after randomization. The main safety end point was major or minor bleeding, according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction bleeding definition.RESULTS:  At 2 years, follow-up clinical data were available for 98.1% of patients. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 13.9% of the aspirin plus cilostazol group versus 22.1% of the aspirin-only group (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.93, P = .021). The rate of major or minor bleeding was not significantly different between the aspirin plus cilostazol and aspirin-only groups (1.6% and 4.0%, respectively, hazard ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.13-1.28, P = .12).S:  In patients who underwent coronary stent implantation, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin therapy was associated with lower rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 2 years compared with aspirin monotherapy.
"" To determine the prevalence, clinical implications and underlying mechanism of aspirin resistance in Chinese patients.METHODS:  Platelet aggregation was determined by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) using four different inducers. Patients were divided into aspirin-resistant (AR), aspirin semi responder (ASR) and aspirin-sensitive (AS) groups, according to their LTA results. Aspirin resistance was assessed by thrombo elastography (TEG, with arachidonic acid [AA] or adenosine diphosphate as inducers), serum/urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-DH-TXB2) assay, platelet function analyser-100 assay and P-selectin assay. Polymorphisms in the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) gene (A842G, C50T, C22T, G128A, C644A and C714A), the PTGS2 gene (G765C) and the integrin β3 (ITGB3) gene (C196T) were examined.RESULTS:  The study included 360 aspirin-treated patients and 314 healthy controls. AS patients had significantly lower levels of 11-DH-TXB2 than AR and ASR patients, and significantly lower levels of P-selectin than AR patients. TEG-AA was more sensitive, specific and consistent than P-selectin in detecting aspirin resistance. The frequency of the PTGS2 G765C mutation was significantly higher in the AR/ASR groups versus the AS group.S:  TEG-AA was more sensitive, specific and consistent than the P-selectin assay for detecting aspirin resistance, and the PTGS2 G765C mutation may be related to aspirin resistance.
Clopidogrel is a prodrug that undergoes bioconversion via cytochrome P450 system to form an active metabolite (AM) that binds to the platelet ADP receptor. The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is commonly assessed by measuring the aggregatory response to 5 μM ADP by light transmission aggregation (LTA) or multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) or by the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI). To determine which of these three tests of platelet ADP receptor pathway inhibition most closely correlates with clopidogrel AM levels. We analyzed blood samples from 82 patients with coronary artery disease who were randomized to receive double-dose or standard dose clopidogrel for 2 weeks. We measured peak clopidogrel AM levels, platelet aggregation in response to ADP and VASP-PRI on days 1, and repeated all the measures on days 7 and 14. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the correlation between clopidogrel AM and LTA, MEA and VASP-PRI. Bland-Altman plots were used to explore the agreement between tests of the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel AM on day 1 correlated most closely with VASP-PRI (r = -0.5767) and demonstrated weaker correlations with LTA (r = -0.4656) and MEA (r = -0.3384) (all p < 0.01). Intra-class correlation (ICC) between VASP-PRI and LTA was 0.6446; VASP-PRI and MEA was 0.4720; and LTA and MEA was 0.4693. Similar results were obtained on days 7 and 14. Commonly used pharmacodynamic measures of clopidogrel response are only moderately correlated with clopidogrel AM levels and may not be suitable to measure the adequacy of clopidogrel therapy.
 No human physiological data exists on whether aspirin only is as effective as warfarin plus aspirin in preventing cerebral microembolization in the early postoperative period after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (bAVR).METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We prospectively enrolled 56 patients who had no other indication for oral anticoagulation, who underwent bAVR and received, in an open-label fashion, either daily warfarin (for INR 2.0-3.0) plus 81 mg of aspirin (n=28) or 325 mg of aspirin only (n=28). Cerebral microembolization was quantified at 4 hours (baseline) and at 1 month postoperatively, by recording 1-hour bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) microembolic signals (MES). Platelet-function analysis (PFA) of closure times (CT) on collagen was also used as a marker of platelet-dependent activation. Follow-up to 1 year was complete. Preoperative demographics and baseline platelet function were equivalent in both groups. There was no mortality, stroke, or transient ischemic attack at 1 year in either group. No significant differences were found in the proportion of patients with MES among those receiving warfarin plus aspirin versus aspirin only, at baseline (68% versus 82%, respectively; P=0.4) and at 1 month (46% versus 43%; P=1.0) after bAVR. The total MES and PFA were also equivalent between groups, at baseline and follow-up.S:  Early after bAVR, the effects of these 2 antithrombotic regimens on cerebral microembolization and platelet function are equivalent. These data bring new mechanistic support to the premise that aspirin only may safely be used early after bAVR in patients who have no other indication for oral anticoagulation.
"" To evaluate the effect of aspirin and nonaspirin antiplatelet agents (NAAAs) on the performance of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: "PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS" We performed a post hoc analysis of results from a clinical trial that involved 28,696 asymptomatic average-risk men and women aged 50 to 69 years invited to participate in a colorectal cancer screening program with FIT between November 1, 2008, and June 31, 2011.RESULTS:  The test was returned by 6390 individuals (22.3%), of whom 5821 (91.1%) reported not using antiplatelet drugs (nonusers group) and 569 (8.9%) reported using these drugs at the time of testing (users group). The FIT result was positive in 48 of 569 users (8.4%) and 365 of 5821 nonusers (6.3%) (P=.05). A positive FIT result was found in 7.3% (28/384) of aspirin users, 7.1% (10/140) of NAAA users, and 22.2% (10/45) of those undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin plus an NAAA). The DAPT subgroup had a significantly higher positive FIT rate than the nonuser group (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.3; P<.05). The positive predictive value (PPV) for advanced neoplasia (AN) in nonusers was 50.4% vs 50.0% in users (P = .40). The PPV for AN was 57.0% in aspirin users, 30.0% in NAAA users, and 50.0% in DAPT users, without statistically significant differences between the user and nonuser groups.: "" The use of DAPT increased the rate of positive FIT results. Use of aspirin, NAAAs, or both did not modify the PPV for AN in this population-based colorectal screening program.
 The Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) trial found no difference in the primary outcome between warfarin and aspirin in 2305 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in sinus rhythm. However, it is unknown whether any subgroups benefit from warfarin or aspirin.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" We used a Cox model stepwise selection procedure to identify subgroups that may benefit from warfarin or aspirin on the WARCEF primary outcome. A secondary analysis added major hemorrhage to the outcome. The primary efficacy outcome was time to the first to occur of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or death. Only age group was a significant treatment effect modifier (P for interaction, 0.003). Younger patients benefited from warfarin over aspirin on the primary outcome (4.81 versus 6.76 events per 100 patient-years: hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.84; P=0.001). In older patients, therapies did not differ (9.91 versus 9.01 events per 100 patient-years: hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.35; P=0.44). With major hemorrhage added, in younger patients the event rate remained lower for warfarin than aspirin (5.41 versus 7.25 per 100 patient-years: hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.89; P=0.005), but in older patients it became significantly higher for warfarin (11.80 versus 9.35 per 100 patient-years: hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.53; P=0.03).S:  In patients <60 years, warfarin improved outcomes over aspirin with or without inclusion of major hemorrhage. In patients ≥60 years, there was no treatment difference, but the aspirin group had significantly better outcomes when major hemorrhage was included.
"" There is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for optimal antiplatelet therapy following a stroke while on aspirin. The objective was to compare clopidogrel initiation vs aspirin reinitiation for vascular risk reduction among patients with ischaemic stroke on aspirin at the time of their index stroke.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Retrospective.SETTING: "SETTING" We conducted a nationwide cohort study by retrieving all hospitalised patients (≥18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ischaemic stroke between 2003 and 2009 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.PARTICIPANTS: "PARTICIPANTS" Among 3862 patients receiving aspirin before the index ischaemic stroke and receiving either aspirin or clopidogrel after index stroke during follow-up period, 1623 were excluded due to a medication possession ratio <80%. Also, 355 were excluded due to history of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or coagulopathy. Therefore, 1884 patients were included in our final analysis.INTERVENTIONS: "INTERVENTIONS" Patients were categorised into two groups based on whether clopidogrel or aspirin was prescribed during the follow-up period. Follow-up was from time of the index stroke to admission for recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction, death or the end of 2010.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: "PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES" The primary end point was hospitalisation due to a new-onset major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: composite of any stroke or myocardial infarction). The leading secondary end point was any recurrent stroke.RESULTS:  Compared to aspirin, clopidogrel was associated with a lower occurrence of future MACE (HR=0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.68, p<0.001, number needed to treat: 8) and recurrent stroke (HR=0.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.69, p<0.001, number needed to treat: 9) after adjustment of relevant covariates.S:  Among patients with an ischaemic stroke while taking aspirin, clopidogrel initiation was associated with fewer recurrent vascular events than aspirin reinitiation.
 The value of aspirin in primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify women who benefit from alternate-day aspirin with regard to all relevant outcomes, including cancer, CVD and major gastrointestinal bleeding.METHODS:  Long term follow-up data of 27 939 healthy women with baseline plasma samples in the Women's Health Study, a randomised trial of 100 mg alternate-day aspirin versus placebo, were used to develop competing risks models for individualised prediction of absolute risk reduction of the combination of CVD, cancer and major gastrointestinal bleeding by aspirin.RESULTS:  Although aspirin was associated with a modestly decreased 15-year risk of colorectal cancer, CVD, and in some women non-colorectal cancer, aspirin treatment resulted in a negative treatment effect in the majority of women if gastrointestinal bleeding was also taken into account. The excess risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding by aspirin increased with age, but the benefits for colorectal cancer and CVD risk were also greater at higher age. Decision curves indicated that selective treatment of women ≥65 years may improve net benefit compared to treating all, none and prediction-based treatment. The observed 15-year number needed to treat to prevent one event among women ≥65 years was 29 (95% CI 12 to 102).S:  Concurrent evaluation of the absolute effects on cancer, CVD and major gastrointestinal bleeding showed that alternate-day use of low-dose aspirin is ineffective or harmful in the majority of women in primary prevention. Selective treatment of women ≥65 years with aspirin may improve net benefit.
 Stroke is common during the first few weeks after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone.METHODS:  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China, we randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days) or to placebo plus aspirin (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1. The primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model, with study center as a random effect.RESULTS:  Stroke occurred in 8.2% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, as compared with 11.7% of those in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.81; P<0.001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin group (P=0.73); the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3% in each group.
 Prior aspirin treatment is considered a risk factor for adverse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. The relationships between aspirin pretreatment and findings on quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), as well as clinical outcomes, are not well understood.METHODS:  In the PROSPECT trial, QCA and triple-vessel IVUS imaging were performed after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit lesion(s) in ACS patients. We compared patients receiving aspirin within 7 days of enrollment to those naive to aspirin. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics.RESULTS:  Aspirin-pretreated patients (n = 236; 35%) were older and more likely to have known coronary disease than those without pretreatment (P≤.01 for all). Pretreated patients had more untreated non-culprit lesions with angiographic and IVUS characteristics predictive of future events (53.1% vs 38.6%; P<.001). There were no significant differences in overall major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates at 3 years between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups (23.6% vs 18.8%, respectively; P=.17) in unadjusted or propensity-adjusted analyses. Prior aspirin use was not an independent predictor of MACE at 3 years (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-2.01; P=.45).: "" In the PROSPECT trial, aspirin pretreatment identifies an older population with more advanced coronary disease. Aspirin pretreatment was not an independent predictor of MACE in ACS patients treated with an early invasive strategy. The extent to which aspirin pretreatment is a risk factor for adverse events after PCI in ACS should be revisited.
 Although there is evidence about the beneficial effects of probiotics, their effects on aspirin-induced small bowel injuries have not been well examined. We evaluated the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2716 (LG) on aspirin-induced small intestinal lesions, such as ulcers, erosions, reddened lesions, and bleeding.SUMMARY: "SUMMARY" This study enrolled 64 patients who received aspirin for more than 1 month and provided written informed consent to be part of the study. The patients received 112 ml of yogurt containing LG or placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. Small bowel injuries were evaluated by capsule endoscopy before and after consuming the yogurt. The effect of LG on patient symptoms was also assessed using the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (FSSG) and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaires before and after 6 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in any baseline characteristics and the number of small bowel mucosal breaks between the 2 groups. In contrast with the placebo group, the LG group had significantly fewer small bowel mucosal breaks and reddened lesions after 6 weeks (p < 0.01). The FSSG and GSRS scores were also significantly improved in the LG group but not in the placebo group. Key Messages: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that LG may be useful in reducing aspirin-induced small bowel injuries and in mitigating gastrointestinal symptoms.
The effect of the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonist vorapaxar on human bleeding time is not known. This was a randomized, two-period, open-label trial in healthy men (n = 31) and women (n = 5). In period 1, subjects received 81 mg aspirin q.d. or a vorapaxar regimen achieving steady-state plasma concentrations equivalent to chronic 2.5 mg q.d. doses, for 7 days. In period 2, each group added 7 days of the therapy alternate to that of period 1 without washout. Bleeding time and platelet aggregation using arachidonic acid, ADP, and TRAP agonists were assessed. Bleeding time geometric mean ratio (90% CI) for vorapaxar/baseline was 1.01 (0.88-1.15), aspirin/baseline was 1.32 (1.15-1.51), vorapaxar + aspirin/vorapaxar was 1.47 (1.26-1.70), and vorapaxar + aspirin/aspirin was 1.12 (0.96-1.30). Unlike aspirin, vorapaxar did not prolong bleeding time compared with baseline. Bleeding time following administration of vorapaxar with aspirin was similar to that following aspirin alone.
Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are major contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Several studies aimed to test the effects of low-dose aspirin (ASA) in the prevention of preeclampsia concluded that the beneficial effects of such treatment outweigh adverse ones. Such benefits have not been fully corroborated by larger randomized trials usually carried out in low-risk women, testing a dose of 60 mg/d ASA presumably ingested in the morning, and including women randomized as late as at 26-32 wks of gestation. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, chronotherapy trial on 350 high-risk pregnant women (183 nulliparous), 30.7 ± 5.3 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, and 13.5 ± 1.4 wks of gestation at the time of recruitment. Women were randomly assigned to one of six groups, defined according to treatment (placebo or ASA, 100 mg/d) and time of treatment: upon awakening, 8 h after awakening, or at bedtime. Intervention started at 12-16 wks of gestation and continued until delivery. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) for 48-h at baseline, every 4 wks until the 7th month of gestation, every 2 wks thereafter until delivery, and at puerperium. The effects of ASA on ambulatory BP were markedly dependent on administration time: there was no effect on BP, compared with placebo, when ASA was ingested upon awakening, but the BP reduction was highly statistically significant when low-dose ASA was ingested 8 h after awakening and, to a greater extent, at bedtime (p < .001). At puerperium, 6-8 wks after discontinuation of treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in 24-h BP means between the groups of women who ingested ASA at different circadian times. Women ingesting low-dose ASA, compared with placebo, evidenced a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) of serious adverse outcomes, a composite of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and stillbirth (.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .22-.56; p < .001). The HR of individual outcome variables, i.e., preeclampsia, preterm delivery, IUGR, and gestational hypertension, were also significantly lower with ASA versus placebo (p always < .041). There were small and nonsignificant differences in outcomes between placebo and low-dose ASA ingested upon awakening. These four groups combined showed highly significant greater event rate of serious adverse outcomes than women ingesting ASA either in the evening or at bedtime (HR: .19, 95% CI: .10-.39; p < .001). There was no increased risk of hemorrhage, either before or after delivery, with low-dose ASA relative to placebo (HR: .57, 95% CI: .25-1.33; p = .194). Results indicate that (i) 100 mg/d ASA should be the recommended minimum dose for prevention of complications in pregnancy; (ii) ingestion of low-dose ASA should start at ≤16 wks of gestation; and (iii) low-dose ASA ingested at bedtime, but not upon awakening, significantly regulates ambulatory BP and reduces the incidence of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, and IUGR. ABPM evaluation at the first trimester of pregnancy provides sensitive endpoints for identification of women at high risk for preeclampsia who might benefit most from the cost-effective preventive intervention with timed low-dose ASA.
 Diabetes is associated with a high rate of events after acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention despite aspirin treatment. Once daily aspirin might not provide 24-hour stable biological efficacy in patients with diabetes. We compared the biological efficacy of the same daily dose of aspirin given either once (OPD) or divided twice per day in a population of diabetic patients with previous coronary artery disease.METHODS:  Ninety-two consecutive diabetic patients with at least 1 criteria of time-dependent aspirin efficacy, elevated high-sensibility C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen, platelet count, or active smoking were prospectively included. Consecutive patients were randomly treated with 150-mg aspirin daily given either OPD (150 mg in the morning) or twice per day (75 mg in the morning and 75 mg in the evening) in a crossover study. The main outcome was platelet reactivity to arachidonic acid (0.5 mg/mL) measured by light transmission aggregometry at trough level before morning aspirin intake.RESULTS:  Mean maximum aggregation intensity triggered by arachidonic acid was 19.7% ± 15.4% on OPD and 11.9% ± 10.4% on twice per day (P < .0001). Biological resistance (maximum aggregation intensity ≥20%) was observed in 42% of patients on OPD and 17% on twice per day (P < .001). Of the 39 patients with biological resistance on OPD, 24 (62%) overcame resistance on twice per day. Of the 16 resistant on twice per day, only 1 patient (6%) overcame resistance on OPD. Results were concordant with global evaluation of platelet reactivity by Platelet Function Analyzer-100. A better twice per day efficacy was independent of clopidogrel cotreatment.: "" In a population of diabetic patients with coronary artery disease and a high risk of time-dependent aspirin resistance, aspirin divided twice per day can significantly decrease the rate of biological loss of efficacy at trough level.
 A substantial proportion of patients have recurrence of vascular events despite daily intake of low-dose aspirin therapy. Therefore, different patients may require different aspirin dosages to achieve complete inhibition of platelet function.: "" The aim of this work was to measure the response to low-dose aspirin therapy (150 mg/day) among patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and to find out whether titrating aspirin dosage to 300 mg/day, would provide a better therapeutic response in the resistant cases. Moreover, we also aimed to study any association between aspirin non-responsiveness and atherothrombotic risk factors.METHODS:  The antiplatelet effect of 150 mg/day aspirin was studied prospectively in 50 consecutive patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Platelet aggregation was measured using optical platelet aggregometry and serum thromboxane B(2) level. Aspirin resistance was defined as collagen (1 μg/mL) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (5 μmol/L)-induced platelet aggregation of ≥ 40% when compared with control values. Twenty healthy age- and sex-matched individuals were taken as a control group. All patients were subjected to complete medical history (risk factors, medications), thorough clinical examination, ECG, coronary angiography and laboratory investigations including: complete haemogram, coagulation, kidney, liver and lipid profiles, fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1C) ).RESULTS:  Eleven of 50 patients (22%) were found to be aspirin resistant. A highly significant difference was found between the mean values of ADP, collagen-induced platelet aggregation percentage and thromboxane B(2) level after aspirin 150 mg/day when compared with the corresponding mean values after aspirin 300 mg/day among the resistant patients (66 ± 7.01%, 62 ± 4.34% and 620 ± 64.58 pg/mL, respectively, vs. 26.87 ± 2.85%, 16.5 ± 3.8% and 77 ± 11.3 pg/mL) indicating enhanced response to aspirin after escalating the dose. The presence of atherothrombotic risk factors (hypertension, smoking, family history of ischaemic heart disease and previous MI) were not statistically different between aspirin-resistant and aspirin-sensitive patients. However, there was a highly significant difference between the aspirin sensitive and the resistant patients regarding the other risk factors (diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia) (P < 0.01).: "" There is inter-individual variability in response to the antiplatelet effect of standard doses of aspirin (150, 300 mg/day). The response to aspirin 300 mg/day is enhanced in resistant patients when compared to 150 mg/day. There was a significant association between aspirin resistance and atherothrombotic risk factors (diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and obesity).
It is implicated that diabetic patients are more resistant to aspirin therapy than patients with other diseases or healthy individuals. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of aspirin on aggregation and the cyclooxygenase activity of platelets of 10 patients with severe type-2 diabetes mellitis (DM) and compared the results with those of healthy individuals. Although platelet aggregation had a tendency to be more resistant to aspirin with the DM group, there was no significant difference in half maximal inhibitory concentration 50 values of aspirin on the cyclooxygenase activity between the patients with DM and healthy individuals. Thus, the residual platelet aggregability uninhibited by aspirin appears to be independent of the cyclooxygenase activity. Since adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor blocking almost completely inhibited the residual platelet aggregability, it is suggested that hyperreactivity to ADP is more prevalent in patients with DM. 
Clopidogrel and aspirin are commonly prescribed anti-platelet medications indicated for patients who have experienced, or are at risk for, ischemic cardiovascular events. The Pharmacogenomics of Anti-Platelet Intervention (PAPI) Study was designed to characterize determinants of clopidogrel and dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) response in a healthy cohort of Old Order Amish from Lancaster, PA. Following a loading dose, clopidogrel was taken once a day for 7 days. One hour after the last dose of clopidogrel, 325 mg of aspirin was given. Ex vivo platelet aggregometry was performed at baseline, post-clopidogrel, and post-DAPT. Platelet aggregation measurements were significantly lower after both interventions for all agonists tested (p <0.05), although there was large inter-individual variation in the magnitude of anti-platelet response. Female sex and older age were associated with higher platelet aggregation at all three time-points. Change in aggregation was correlated among the various agonists at each time point. Heritability (h2) of change in platelet aggregation was significant for most traits at all time-points (range h2=0.14-0.57). Utilization of a standardized, short-term intervention provided a powerful approach to investigate sources of variation in platelet aggregation response due to drug therapy. Further, this short-term intervention approach may provide a useful paradigm for pharmacogenomics studies. 
"AIM" The AVERROES double-blinded, randomized trial demonstrated that apixaban reduces the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) by 55% compared with aspirin without an increase in major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation either who previously tried but failed vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy or who were expected to be unsuitable for VKA therapy. In this pre-specified analysis, we explored the consistency of the results in the subgroup of patients who tried but failed VKA therapy.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" Of 5599 patients, 2216 (40%) had previously failed VKA treatment [main reasons: poor international normalized ratio (INR) control 42%, refusal 37%, bleeding on VKA 8%]. Compared with those expected to be unsuitable for VKA therapy, those who had previously failed were older, more often male, had higher body mass index, more likely to have moderate renal impairment and a history of stroke and less likely to have heart failure or to be medically undertreated. The effects of apixaban compared with aspirin were consistent in those who previously failed and those who were expected to be unsuitable, for both SSE (P interaction 0.13) and major bleeding (P interaction 0.74) and were also consistent among different subgroups of patients who had previously failed VKA therapy defined by reasons for unsuitability, age, sex, renal function, CHADS2 score, aspirin dose, duration, indication, and quality of INR control of prior VKA use.: "" The efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with aspirin is consistent in subgroups of patients who have previously attempted but failed VKA therapy, irrespective of the reason for discontinuation.
 Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) degrades heme and protects against oxidative stress. In vitro and animal models suggest that HO-1 is beneficial in several diseases (e.g., postoperative ileus, gastroparesis, acute pancreatitis, and colitis). However, the only drugs (i.e., hemin and heme arginate) which pharmacologically upregulate HO-1 in humans are expensive and can only be administered intravenously. Our aims were to compare the effects of placebo, aspirin, and simvastatin alone, and with α-lipoic acid, on HO-1 protein concentration and activity in humans.METHODS:  This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the effects of three oral regimens administered for 7 days, i.e., placebo; aspirin (325 mg twice daily) and simvastatin (40 mg twice daily); aspirin, simvastatin, and the sodium salt of R- α-lipoic acid (NaRLA, 600 mg three times daily) on markers of HO-1 activation (i.e., plasma HO-1 protein concentration and venous monocyte HO-1 protein activity) in 18 healthy subjects (14 females). Markers of HO-1 activation were evaluated at baseline, days 2, and 7.KEY RESULTS: "KEY RESULTS" Baseline HO-1 protein concentrations and activity were similar among the three groups. Compared to placebo, aspirin and simvastatin combined, or together with NaRLA did not affect HO-1 protein concentration or activity at 2 or 7 days. HO-1 protein concentrations and activity were correlated on day 7 (r = 0.75, p = 0.0004) but not at baseline and on day 2.S &amp; INFERENCES: "S &amp; INFERENCES" At therapeutic doses, aspirin, simvastatin, and α-lipoic acid do not increase plasma HO-1 protein concentration or venous monocyte HO-1 activity in healthy humans.
Current guidelines recommend that adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease take low-dose aspirin or other antiplatelet medications as secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Yet, no national level assessment of low-dose aspirin use for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease has been reported in a community-based population. Using data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, we assessed low-dose aspirin use in those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We estimated the prevalence ratios of low-dose aspirin use, adjusting for sociodemographic status, health insurance, and cardiovascular risk factors. In those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n = 3,068), 76% had been instructed to take aspirin and 88% of those were following this advice. Of those not advised, 11% took aspirin on their own. Overall, 70% were taking aspirin (including those who followed their health care provider's advice and those who were not advised but took aspirin on their own). Logistic regression models showed that women, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, those aged 40 to 64 years, with a high school education or with some college, or with fewer cardiovascular disease risk factors were less likely to take aspirin than men, non-Hispanic whites, those aged ≥65 years, with a college education or higher, or with all 4 selected cardiovascular disease risk factors, respectively. Additional analyses conducted in those with coronary heart disease only (n = 2,007) showed similar patterns. In conclusion, use of low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention was 70%, with high reported adherence to health care providers' advice to take low-dose aspirin (88%) and significant variability within subgroups.
Bleeding negatively affects prognosis and adherence to antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). The potential association of on-aspirin platelet reactivity and bleeding is not established. We sought to determine whether low on-aspirin platelet reactivity (LAPR) is associated with bleeding events and antiplatelet therapy compliance in patients with ACSs receiving coronary stenting. On-aspirin platelet reactivity was measured by the VerifyNow™ Aspirin assay (Accumetrics Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in 531 patients with ACS. Cut-offs for LAPR were calculated by receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Bleeding was reported according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition. The endpoints were minor bleeding (BARC types 1 or 2), major bleeding (BARC types 3 or 5) and antiplatelet therapy cessation during 6-months follow-up. By ROC analysis the VerifyNow™ Aspirin assay was able to distinguish between patients with and without minor bleeding (area under the curve [AUC] 0.66, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.70, P < 0.0001) whereas major bleeding could not be predicted by the assay (AUC 0.54, 95 % CI 0.49-0.58, P = 0.473). By logistic regression, LAPR was associated with increased risk of minor bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 4.32, 95 % CI 2.78-6.71, P < 0.0001) but not major bleeding (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 0.83-5.06, P = 0.117). Antiplatelet therapy discontinuation was more frequent in patients with LAPR as compared to those with no LAPR (21.6 vs. 9.1 %, P = 0.0008). In conclusion, early point-of-care on-aspirin platelet reactivity testing in ACS may identify patients with increased risk of minor bleeding events and subsequent discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. The possible impact of LAPR on major bleeding needs to be determined in larger trials.
ESSENTIALS: In acute coronary syndromes, dual antiplatelet therapy inhibits platelets but confers a bleeding risk. Healthy male volunteers received clopidogrel or ticagrelor plus aspirin or clopidogrel or ticagrelor alone. The decrease in β-thromboglobulin in shed blood was comparable after single and dual antiplatelet therapy. We hypothesize that patients with acute coronary syndromes may not require dual antiplatelet therapy.BACKGROUND:  Dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin is standard in acute coronary syndromes. Dual antiplatelet therapy causes more bleeding than single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor.S: "S" To compare the effects of dual and single antiplatelet therapies on hemostatic system activation.PATIENTS/METHODS: "PATIENTS/METHODS" In a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 44 healthy volunteers received clopidogrel (600 mg, then 150 mg d(-1) ) and aspirin (100 mg d(-1) ) or placebo for 7 days; An additional 44 volunteers received single-dose ticagrelor (180 mg) and aspirin (300 mg) or placebo. β-Thromboglobulin (β-TG [IU L(-1) ]) and prothrombin fragment 1.2 (f1.2 [nmol L(-1) ]) were measured in blood obtained from bleeding time incisions. Data are given as geometric mean ratio (GMR [95% confidence interval]) to describe the differences in the first 2 h and as mean differences (Δ [95% confidence interval]) in area under the curve (AUC) to discriminate differences in effects over the total observation time.RESULTS:  Clopidogrel plus aspirin and clopidogrel plus placebo reduced β-TG by a GMR of 0.51 (0.42-0.63) and 0.54 (0.46-0.64) at 2 h. Ticagrelor plus aspirin and ticagrelor plus placebo decreased β-TG by a GMR of 0.38 (0.26-0.57) and 0.47 (0.31-0.72). Ticagrelor plus aspirin and ticagrelor plus placebo reduced f1.2 by a GMR of 0.58 (0.45-0.75) and 0.55 (0.38-0.80); clopidogrel did not. Over 24 h, no difference in β-TG occurred between clopidogrel plus aspirin and clopidogrel plus placebo (ΔAUC = -2.9 [-9.9 to 4.1]) or between ticagrelor plus aspirin and ticagrelor plus placebo (ΔAUC = -3.5 [-11.8 to 4.7]). No difference in f1.2 occurred between clopidogrel plus aspirin and clopidogrel plus placebo (ΔAUC = -4.2 [-10.2 to 1.8]) or between ticagrelor plus aspirin and ticagrelor plus placebo (ΔAUC = -3.6 [-10.9 to 3.7]).S:  P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and dual antiplatelet therapy inhibit hemostatic system activation to a comparable extent.
Cilostazol is a platelet inhibitor which when added to aspirin and clopidogrel has shown to reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic events without an increase in bleeding. These clinical benefits have shown to be more pronounced in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, it remains unknown whether cilostazol exerts different pharmacodynamic effects in patients with and without DM. This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pharmacodynamic study comparing platelet function in patients with and without DM on aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. Patients (n=111) were randomly assigned to either cilostazol 100 mg or placebo twice daily for 14 days and afterwards crossed-over treatment for another 14 days. Platelet function was performed at baseline, 14 days post-randomisation, and 14 days post-cross-over. Functional testing to assess P2Y12 signalling included flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylation status of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein measured by P2Y12 reactivity index (PRI), light transmittance aggregometry and VerifyNow. Thrombin generation processes were also studied using thrombelastography. Significantly lower PRI values were observed following treatment with cilostazol compared with placebo both in DM and non-DM groups (p < 0.0001). The absolute between-treatment differences of PRI between groups was a 35.1% lower in patients with DM (p=0.039). Similar results were obtained using all other functional measures assessing P2Y12 signalling. Thrombin generation was not affected by cilostazol. Cilostazol reduces platelet reactivity both in patients with and without DM, although these pharmacodynamic effects are enhanced in patients with DM. Despite the marked platelet inhibition, cilostazol does not alter thrombin-mediated haemostatic processes, which may explain its ischaemic benefit without the increased risk of bleeding.
"S" We sought to examine the effects of escalating doses of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements on platelet function using light transmission aggregometry (LTA) and electrophoretic quasi-elastic light scattering technology (EQELS).BACKGROUND:  PUFA may inhibit platelet function through fatty acid substitution in the platelet membrane by changing the surface charge density and causing decreased production of thromboxane A2. EQELS can measure platelet surface charge density and determine whether the platelet is in resting or activated state.METHODS:  A total of 30 volunteers were divided in 3 groups of 10 as follows: Group A, no antiplatelet agent; Group B, daily aspirin only, and Group C, daily aspirin and clopidogrel. All patients received escalating doses of omega-3PUFA from 1 to 8 g daily over 24 weeks. Platelet function was measured by template bleeding time, LTA, and EQELS at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks.RESULTS:  Mean bleeding time increased in a dose-dependent manner with escalating omega-3 PUFA doses. LTA confirmed expected antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel, but did not detect any additional antiplatelet effects of omega-3 PUFA. EQELS showed a significant increase in the negative resting platelet charge compared to baseline and an attenuated response to arachidonic acid mediated platelet activation. No bleeding events were observed.S:  In this pilot study we were able to successfully measure platelet surface charge variation as a measure of omega-3 PUFA effect on platelets. Our results suggest that omega-3 PUFA increase the total platelet surface charge and, therefore, attenuate platelet activation, even among patients taking aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these measured effects and EQELS results.
Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin.METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboembolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding.RESULTS: A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups.
 Numerous open trials have demonstrated the beneficial clinical effects of aspirin desensitization (AD) in patients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). These beneficial effects might be attributable to aspirin's potent anti-inflammatory properties, but that supposition requires further corroboration.: "" We sought to compare the clinical and biochemical responses to chronic oral AD in 20 patients with AIA and 14 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA). All of the patients had chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis, and these responses were investigated in a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.METHODS:  Twelve patients with AIA and 6 patients with ATA were randomly assigned to receive 624 mg of aspirin, and 8 patients with AIA and 8 patients with ATA received placebo. Both aspirin and placebo were administered once daily for 6 months. Nasal symptoms, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT20) scores, peak nasal inspiratory flows, Asthma Control Questionnaire scores, spirometric parameters, peak expiratory flows, blood eosinophilia, and corticosteroid doses were assessed on a monthly basis. Levels of urinary leukotriene E4 and the stable plasma prostaglandin (PG) D2 metabolite 9α,11β-PGF2 were evaluated at baseline and after 1, 3, 5, and 6 months.RESULTS:  Only the patients with AIA subjected to AD reported improvements in smell and reductions in sneezing and nasal blockade. The SNOT20 and Asthma Control Questionnaire scores of these patients decreased, and their peak nasal inspiratory flows increased. The dosages of inhaled corticosteroids were reduced. There were no changes in leukotriene E(4) or 9α,11β-PGF(2) levels after AD.: "" The clinically beneficial effects of AD on nasal and bronchial symptoms occurred only in the patients with AIA.
 A common regimen for patients requiring dual-antiplatelet therapy who are at risk for gastrointestinal complications is the synchronous administration of enteric-coated (EC) aspirin, a proton pump inhibitor, and clopidogrel, although proton pump inhibitors have the potential for pharmacodynamic interaction with clopidogrel. Spaced administration of a clopidogrel and a single-tablet formulation of aspirin and immediate-release omeprazole (PA32540) was considered as an alternative that might reduce this potential pharmacodynamic interaction.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" A randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects (n = 30). Two 7-day treatments were separated by 14-day washout periods: (a) PA32540 + clopidogrel (300 mg loading/75 mg maintenance) 10 hours later and (b) synchronous dosing of clopidogrel + EC aspirin (81 mg) + EC omeprazole (40 mg). The primary end point was the inhibition of platelet aggregation (20 μM adenosine diphosphate, maximal extent) after 7 days. CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genotypes were determined. Inhibition of platelet aggregation was greater with spaced PA32540 + clopidogrel therapy vs synchronous clopidogrel + EC aspirin + EC omeprazole therapy (P = .004). There was no difference in day 7 arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. The effect of spacing on pharmacodynamics was independent of genotype.S:  PA32540 and clopidogrel spaced 10 hours apart had greater antiplatelet effects than did synchronously administered EC aspirin (81 mg), clopidogrel (75 mg), and EC omeprazole in healthy volunteers. These finding are directly relevant to the treatment for patients with high gastrointestinal risk who require dual-antiplatelet therapy and gastroprotection.
 The role of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA [aspirin]) and warfarin in secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is well established. However, there are sparse data comparing the presentation and outcomes of patients who present with ACS while on ASA and/or warfarin therapy and those on neither.METHODS:  Using data from the Canadian Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), we stratified 14,090 ACS patients into 4 groups according to prior use of antithrombotic therapies and compared in-hospital management and outcomes.RESULTS:  Among 14,090 ACS patients, 7411 (52.6%) were not on prior ASA or warfarin therapy, 5724 (40.6%) were on ASA only, 593 (4.2%) were on warfarin only, and 362 (2.6%) were on both ASA and warfarin. ACS patients taking ASA and/or warfarin were older with more comorbidities than the patients on neither drug. Patients receiving prior warfarin only or ASA and warfarin were less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies. Patients who were taking prior warfarin only had higher unadjusted rates of death, death and/or reinfarction (re-MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and major bleeding as compared with patients on no prior therapy. Furthermore, patients who were taking ASA and warfarin had higher unadjusted rates of death and/or re-MI and CHF than patients on prior ASA only.S:  ACS patients on prior warfarin are a high-risk population, yet they receive less guideline-recommended therapies and have higher unadjusted adverse event rates during their index hospitalization. With the increasing use of oral anticoagulants, clinical trials are needed to guide the optimal management of these ACS patients.
 In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54), ticagrelor reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events when added to low-dose aspirin in stable patients with prior myocardial infarction, resulting in the approval of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily for long-term secondary prevention. We investigated the incidence of stroke, outcomes after stroke, and the efficacy of ticagrelor focusing on the approved 60 mg twice daily dose for reducing stroke in this population.METHODS:  Patients were followed for a median of 33 months. Stroke events were adjudicated by a central committee. Data from similar trials were combined using meta-analysis.RESULTS:  Of 14 112 patients randomly assigned to placebo or ticagrelor 60 mg, 213 experienced a stroke; 85% of these strokes were ischemic. A total of 18% of strokes were fatal and another 15% led to either moderate or severe disability at 30 days. Ticagrelor significantly reduced the risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.98; P=0.034), driven by a reduction in ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.02). Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 9 patients on placebo and 8 patients on ticagrelor. A meta-analysis across 4 placebo-controlled trials of more intensive antiplatelet therapy in 44 816 patients with coronary disease confirmed a marked reduction in ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.81; P=0.0001).S:  High-risk patients with prior myocardial infarction are at risk for stroke, approximately one-third of which are fatal or lead to moderate-to-severe disability. The addition of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced this risk without an excess of hemorrhagic stroke but with more major bleeding. In high-risk patients with coronary disease, more intensive antiplatelet therapy should be considered not only to reduce the risk of coronary events, but also of stroke.
 The fixed-dose combination of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 25 mg plus extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg (ASA+ER-DP) is used for long-term secondary stroke prevention in patients who have experienced non-cardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Although the theoretical risk is low that the antiplatelet activity of ASA+ER-DP will be affected by concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.: "" This study aimed to determine whether the PPI omeprazole influences the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) behavior of ASA+ER-DP.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: "STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING" This was a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, crossover, drug-drug interaction study carried out in a clinical trial unit.PARTICIPANTS: "PARTICIPANTS" Sixty healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-50 years were included in the study.INTERVENTION: "INTERVENTION" Participants were randomized to one of two treatment sequences (ABCD or CDAB), each comprising four 7-day treatments with a washout of ≥14 days between the second and third treatments. Treatment A=ASA+ER-DP 25 mg/200 mg (Aggrenox®) twice daily (BID) alone; B=ASA+ER-DP 25 mg/200 mg BID+omeprazole (Prilosec®) 80 mg once daily (QD) following ASA+ER-DP alone for 7 days; C=omeprazole 80 mg QD alone; D=omeprazole 80 mg QD+ASA+ER-DP 25 mg/200 mg BID following omeprazole alone for 7 days.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES" The main outcome measures were systemic PK exposure to ER-DP and ASA inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation.RESULTS:  Systemic exposure to ER-DP was similar with and without omeprazole, based on steady-state area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12,ss, ng·h/mL) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax,ss, ng/mL). For the treatment comparison D versus A, the percent mean ratios were 96.38 (90% confidence interval [CI] 90.96-102.13) for AUC0-12,ss and 92.03 (86.95-97.40) for Cmax,ss. The ER-DP concentration versus time profiles were nearly superimposable. There was no effect on the PDs of the ASA component: the extent of ASA inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was almost identical with and without omeprazole, with a percent mean ratio for treatment D versus A = 99.02 (90 % CI 98.32-99.72) at 4 h after last dose. All treatments were well tolerated.: "" The PK and PD behavior of ASA + ER-DP was not altered by concurrent administration of omeprazole.
 The cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) is involved in metabolism of endogenous compounds, drugs, and procarcinogens. Two common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in CYP2C9 are associated with reduced enzyme activity: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, R144C) and CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, I359L).METHODS:  We investigated whether CYP2C9 genotype was associated with risk of colorectal adenoma and/or modified associations with aspirin treatment or cigarette smoking in a cohort of 928 participants in a randomized trial of aspirin chemoprevention. Generalized linear regression was used to compute relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). Multiplicative interactions terms were used to assess effect modification.RESULTS:  CYP2C9 genotype was associated with increased risks for adenoma recurrence of 29 % (RR = 1.29, 95 % CI 1.09-1.51) for ≥1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) and 47 % (RR = 1.47, 95 % CI 1.19-1.83) for ≥1 CYP2C9*3 allele. The risk for advanced lesions or multiple (≥3) adenomas was increased by 64 % (RR = 1.64, 95 % CI 1.18-2.28) for ≥1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) and 79 % (RR = 1.79, 95 % CI 1.16-2.75) for ≥1 CYP2C9*3 allele. Genotype modified associations with smoking, but not aspirin treatment. The adenoma risk was increased by 26 % (RR = 1.26, 95 % CI 0.99-1.58) for former smokers and 60 % (RR = 1.60, 95 % CI 1.19-2.15) for current smokers among wild-type individuals, but there was no increased risk among individuals with ≥1 variant allele (CYP2C9*2 or *3) (p                   (interaction) = 0.04).S:  Carriers of CYP2C9 variants with lower enzyme activity have increased overall risk of colorectal adenoma but reduced adenoma risk associated with cigarette smoking. These results may be due to effects on the synthesis of endogenous eicosanoids and/or reduced activation of procarcinogens in smoke by CYP2C9 variants.
Aspirin resistance and chronic renal failure are both potentially important clinical issues in coronary artery disease. To test the hypothesis of a relationship between the two, we recruited 169 stable outpatients with proven coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, intra-coronary stents) taking 75 mg aspirin daily. Blood was taken for light transmission aggregometry to agonists arachidonic acid (0.5mg/mL) and adenosine diphosphate (10 μmol/L), for platelet marker soluble P selectin (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), resting and stimulated expression of CD62P (flow cytometry) and for renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate). The estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower when aspirin resistance was defined by response to arachidonic acid after 3, 5 and 7 minutes (approximately 30% of patients) (p<0.021), and when defined by response to adenosine diphosphate after 3 minutes (approximately 17% of patients)(p=0.015) compared to those who were sensitive to aspirin. Mean [standard deviation] soluble P selectin levels were 57 [23] ng/mL in 49 patients with aspirin resistance, and 50 [15] ng/mL in the 119 aspirin sensitive patients (p=0.02). Estimated glomerular filtration rate correlated inversely with platelet CD62P expression at rest (r=-0.22, p=0.004), and when stimulated by arachidonic acid (r=-0.21, p=0.007) and by adenosine diphosphate (r=-0.17, p=0.023). Aspirin resistance was more than twice as prevalent in those with the greatest renal disease (50% of patients) compared to those with the best renal function (21.4%). Our data point to a weak relationship between worsening glomerular filtration rate and aspirin resistance. Nevertheless, we suspect that failure of patients to be fully responsive to aspirin may be important in the pathophysiology of thrombosis in renal dysfunction.
 Aspirin inhibits colorectal carcinogenesis. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, daily soluble aspirin significantly reduced recurrence of colorectal adenomas at 1-year follow-up. In this study the results of daily intake of low-dose aspirin on polyp recurrence at 4-year follow-up are presented.METHODS:  272 patients (naive for chronic aspirin use) with colorectal adenomas were randomly assigned to treatment with lysine acetylsalicylate 160 mg/day (n=73) or 300 mg/day (n=67) or placebo (n=132) for 4 years. The primary endpoints were adenoma recurrence and adenomatous polyp burden at year 4, comparing aspirin at either dose with placebo. The same endpoints were also assessed at year 1 or 4 (last colonoscopy performed for each patient).RESULTS:  At the final year 4 colonoscopy the analysis included 185 patients (55 receiving aspirin 160 mg/day, 47 aspirin 300 mg/day and 83 placebo). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with at least one recurrent adenoma between patients receiving aspirin at either dose and those treated with placebo (42/102 (41%) vs 33/83 (40%); NS) or in the adenomatous polyp burden (3.1 ± 5.8 mm vs 3.4 ± 6.2 mm; NS). Also, the proportion of patients with at least one advanced recurrent adenoma did not differ (10/102 [corrected] (10%) in the aspirin group vs 7/83 (8.4%) [corrected] in the placebo group; NS).: "" Daily low-dose aspirin decreased adenoma recurrence significantly at 1 year but not at year 4. This discrepancy might be explained by a differential effect of aspirin according to the natural history of the polyp.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" There are few data that demonstrate a significant effect of aspirin therapy for diabetic patients as primary prevention for cardiovascular events. A guideline recommends the use of aspirin as a primary prevention strategy in patients with diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk including those who have additional risk factors. To clarify the effect of primary prevention with aspirin therapy on diabetic patients, the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the incidence of atherosclerotic events was investigated in participants in the Japanese primary prevention of atherosclerosis with aspirin for diabetes (JPAD) trial.METHODS AND SUBJECTS: "METHODS AND SUBJECTS" We divided the JPAD participants according to the CRP level at enrollment; CRP ≥0.1mg/dl: high CRP group, CRP <0.1mg/dl: low CRP group. The high CRP group consisted of 1131 patients and the low CRP group consisted of 398 patients.ESSENTIAL RESULTS: "ESSENTIAL RESULTS" There was no significant difference in the incidence of primary atherosclerotic events between the high CRP group and the low CRP group. Of the atherosclerotic events, the incidence of cerebrovascular events, however, was significantly higher in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group. The incidence of cerebrovascular events was higher in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group in patients without aspirin therapy, although there was no significant difference in the incidence of the cerebrovascular events between the high CRP group and the low CRP group in patients undergoing aspirin therapy.PRINCIPAL S: "PRINCIPAL S" Aspirin therapy may reduce cerebrovascular events in diabetic patients with higher CRP. Aspirin therapy could be an additional strategy as primary prevention for diabetic patients with higher CRP.
"INTRODUCTION" Many diabetics are insensitive to aspirin's platelet anti-aggregation effects. The possible modulating effects of co-administration of aspirin and fish oil in subjects with diabetes are poorly characterized.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: "PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS" Thirty adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with aspirin 81 mg/d for 7 days, then with fish oil 4 g/day for 28 days, then the combination of fish oil and aspirin for another 7 days.RESULTS:  Aspirin alone and in combination with fish oil reduced platelet aggregation in most participants. Five of 7 participants classified as aspirin insensitive 1 week after daily aspirin ingestion were sensitive after the combination. Although some platelet aggregation measures correlated positively after aspirin and fish oil ingestion alone and (in combination) in all individuals, correlation was only observed in those who were aspirin insensitive after ingestion of the combination.S:  Co-administration of aspirin and fish oil may reduce platelet aggregation more than aspirin alone in adults with diabetes mellitus.
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients. Whether aspirin may reduce the risk for CVD, death, and kidney failure outcomes is uncertain.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" Post hoc cohort analysis of FAVORIT, a randomized trial examining the effect of homocysteine-lowering vitamins on CVD in kidney transplant recipients.SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: "SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS" Prevalent adult kidney transplant recipients with hyperhomocysteinemia and stable kidney function from the United States, Canada, and Brazil participating in FAVORIT, with no known history of CVD.PREDICTOR: "PREDICTOR" Aspirin use, with aspirin users matched to nonusers using a propensity score.OUTCOMES: "OUTCOMES" Incident CVD events, kidney failure, all-cause mortality, a composite of CVD events or mortality, and a composite of kidney failure or mortality. Cox proportional hazards models with a robust variance to account for the correlation in outcomes within matched pairs were sequentially adjusted for demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics to assess the association between aspirin use and events.RESULTS:  981 aspirin users were matched to 981 nonusers. During a 4-year mean follow up, there were 225 CVD events, 200 deaths, 126 kidney failure events, 301 composite kidney failure or mortality events, and 324 composite CVD or mortality events. Adjusted models showed no significant difference associated with aspirin use in risk for CVD events, all-cause mortality, kidney failure, composite of kidney failure or mortality, or composite of primary CVD events or mortality (HRs of 1.20 [95% CI, 0.92-1.58], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.69-1.23], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.81-1.74], 1.03 [0.82-1.31], and 1.11 [95% CI, 0.88-1.38], respectively).LIMITATIONS: "LIMITATIONS" We did not examine dose or continued use of aspirin after randomization. CVD history is dependent on participant report at baseline. Aspirin use was non-randomly assigned.S:  Aspirin use is not associated with reduced risk for incident CVD, all-cause mortality, or kidney failure in stable kidney transplant recipients with no history of CVD.
 High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has shown efficacy in relieving neuropathic pain. Whether its analgesic effect also applies to acute physiological nociception remains unclear due to previous contradictory findings.: "" To provide an in-depth investigation of the effects of motor cortex HF-rTMS on acute laser-evoked pain and excitability of nociceptive networks in healthy subjects.METHODS:  Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 20 healthy participants. Laser heat stimuli at nociceptive threshold were delivered to the right hand, allowing assessment of: (a) subjective pain intensity and unpleasantness; (b) laser-evoked potentials (LEPs, 128 electrodes) and their source model; (c) sympathetic skin responses, and (d) spino-thalamic pathway excitability. Data were collected before and 20 minutes after a session of neuro-navigated 20 Hz rTMS to the contralateral motor cortex.RESULTS:  Subjective pain reports to thermal laser pulses, amplitude of late cortical potentials and sympathetic skin responses were decreased after cortical stimulation, to a similar extent whether it was active or placebo. Early cortical potentials and nociceptive network excitability remained identical before and after rTMS, as did anatomical sources of LEPs.S:  Our results do not provide evidence for a genuine anti-nociceptive effect of rTMS on acute physiological pain. We suggest that motor cortex rTMS may act upon high-order networks linked to the emotional and cognitive appraisal of chronic pain, and/or modulate pathologically sensitized networks, rather than change the physiological transmission within an intact nervous system. Such dichotomy is reminiscent of that observed with most drugs used for neuropathic pain.
 Benefit of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in diabetes remains controversial. The American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) recommend aspirin for high-risk diabetic patients: older patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors. We evaluated aspirin's benefit in Japanese diabetic patients stratified by cardiovascular risk.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" In the JPAD trial, we enrolled 2,539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and no history of cardiovascular disease. We randomly assigned them to aspirin (81-100 mg daily) or no aspirin groups. The median follow-up period was 4.4 years. We stratified the patients into high-risk or low-risk groups, according to the US recommendation: age (older; younger) and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. The risk factors included smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease, and proteinuria. Most of the patients were classified into the high-risk group, consisting of older patients with risk factors (n=1,804). The incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in this group, but aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-1.17). In the low-risk group, consisting of older patients without risk factors and younger patients (n=728), aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events (HR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.23-1.21). These results were unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding factors.S:  Low-dose aspirin is not beneficial in Japanese diabetic patients at high risk.
"IMPORTANCE" Acute kidney injury, a common complication of surgery, is associated with poor outcomes and high health care costs. Some studies suggest aspirin or clonidine administered during the perioperative period reduces the risk of acute kidney injury; however, these effects are uncertain and each intervention has the potential for harm.: "" To determine whether aspirin compared with placebo, and clonidine compared with placebo, alters the risk of perioperative acute kidney injury.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" A 2 × 2 factorial randomized, blinded, clinical trial of 6905 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery from 88 centers in 22 countries with consecutive patients enrolled between January 2011 and December 2013.INTERVENTIONS: "INTERVENTIONS" Patients were assigned to take aspirin (200 mg) or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery and then aspirin (100 mg) or placebo daily up to 30 days after surgery, and were assigned to take oral clonidine (0.2 mg) or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery, and then a transdermal clonidine patch (which provided clonidine at 0.2 mg/d) or placebo patch that remained until 72 hours after surgery.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" Acute kidney injury was primarily defined as an increase in serum creatinine concentration from the preoperative concentration by either an increase of 0.3 mg/dL or greater (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours of surgery or an increase of 50% or greater within 7 days of surgery.RESULTS:  Aspirin (n = 3443) vs placebo (n = 3462) did not alter the risk of acute kidney injury (13.4% vs 12.3%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.96-1.25). Clonidine (n = 3453) vs placebo (n = 3452) did not alter the risk of acute kidney injury (13.0% vs 12.7%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.18). Aspirin increased the risk of major bleeding. In a post hoc analysis, major bleeding was associated with a greater risk of subsequent acute kidney injury (23.3% when bleeding was present vs 12.3% when bleeding was absent; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.72-2.83). Similarly, clonidine increased the risk of clinically important hypotension. In a post hoc analysis, clinically important hypotension was associated with a greater risk of subsequent acute kidney injury (14.3% when hypotension was present vs 11.8% when hypotension was absent; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58).S AND RELEVANCE: "S AND RELEVANCE" Among patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, neither aspirin nor clonidine administered perioperatively reduced the risk of acute kidney injury.
 Nasal ketorolac challenge with modified oral aspirin challenge is a safe and effective alternative for desensitizing patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. In addition to clinical judgment, objective tests assessing nasal flow may help in diagnosing nasal reactions.: "" To evaluate the feasibility of peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) as an objective measurement in the assessment of a reaction to nasal ketorolac and to determine changes in PNIF that have adequate sensitivity and specificity.METHODS:  One hundred fifty-one patients referred to the Scripps Clinic for aspirin challenge and desensitization and 14 healthy controls participated in the study. Percentages of decrease in PNIF during reactions were compared with the nonreactors' measurements. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to assess the diagnostic performance of PNIF measurement during a clinically positive nasal challenge.RESULTS:  A total of 165 subjects participated in the study. One hundred fourteen patients (69.1%) clinically reacted to the nasal ketorolac challenge. There was no statistical difference between nasal reactors and nonreactors regarding sex, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and use of systemic steroid before challenge. The mean percentage of decrease in PNIF was significantly higher in the reactor group (-0.30 ± 0.29 vs -0.07 ± 0.16, P < .001). A cutoff value of 25% decrease in PNIF had the maximum sensitivity and specificity (56.1% and 94.1%).: "" The high specificity of a 25% decrease in PNIF found in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that PNIF measurements can be useful for assessing nasal reactions during nasal ketorolac challenges in the diagnosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
 Hypercoagulability, assessed by the thrombelastography (TEG) assay, has in several observational studies been associated with an increased risk of post-procedural thromboembolic complications. We hypothesize that intensified antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin, as compared to aspirin alone, will improve saphenous vein graft patency in preoperatively TEG-Hypercoagulable coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) patients and reduce their risk for thromboembolic complications and death postoperatively.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" This is a prospective randomized clinical trial, with an open-label design with blinded evaluation of graft patency. TEG-Hypercoagulability is defined as a TEG maximum amplitude above 69 mm. Two hundred and fifty TEG-Hypercoagulable patients will be randomized to either an interventional group receiving clopidogrel 75 mg daily for three months (after initial oral bolus of 300 mg) together with aspirin 75 mg or a control group receiving aspirin 75 mg daily alone. Monitoring of antiplatelet efficacy and on-treatment platelet reactivity to clopidogrel and aspirin will be conducted with Multiplate aggregometry. Graft patency will be assessed with Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) at three months after surgery.S:  The present trial is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether TEG-Hypercoagulable CABG patients will benefit from intensified antiplatelet therapy after surgery. Monitoring of platelet inhibition from instituted antithrombotic therapy will elucidate platelet resistance patterns after CABG surgery. The results could be helpful in redefining how clinicians can evaluate patients preoperatively for their postoperative thromboembolic risk and tailor individualized postoperative antiplatelet therapy.
"S" The aim of this study is to compare preoperative and postoperative conditions of GMP-140 concentration, the aggregation and activation of platelets in congenital heart disease patients undergoing transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs) or ventricular septal defects (VSDs), and the appropriate dose of aspirin of patients after transcatheter closure.: "" Thirty-two consecutive patients with ASD (n=16) and VSD (n=16), as shown on transthoracic echocardiography and right heart catheter examination, were treated with a percutaneous catheter occlusion. The patients comprised 13 males and 19 females with a mean age of 25.6±9.15. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups within half an hour after ASD or VSD occlusion. Group A cases were treated with 3 mg/kg/day enteric-coated aspirin tablets for 6 months, while patients in group B received 5 mg/kg/day enteric-coated aspirin tablets for 6 months.RESULTS:  The rates of platelet aggregation (PAG) in the immediate postoperative ASD/VSD occlusion were significantly higher than those in the preoperative ASD/VSD occlusion (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-induced PAG: 64.98%±7.65% vs. 86.33%±6.54%, p<0.05; arachidonic acid [AA]-induced PAG: 62.92%±9.11% vs. 86.96%±6.90%, p<0.05, respectively). After treatment with aspirin, the GMP-140 levels presented a clearly defined downward trend in the immediate postoperative period (3 mg/kg/day aspirin: 18.30±3.42 vs. 13.37±1.80, p<0.05; 5 mg/kg/day aspirin: 18.30±3.42 vs. 13.41±1.60, p<0.05), but no obvious difference was observed considering the GMP-140 levels in the 4 days after occlusion (all p>0.05).: "" Our study showed that the GMP-140 serum level and PAG were increased after ASD and VSD occlusion, and patients may have a trend of decreased GMP-140 serum levels after the ASD or VSD occlusion surgeries after the treatment with aspirin. Daily oral administration of 3 and 5 mg/kg/day aspirin can induce a significant decrease in PAG of patients after VSD/ASD occlusion.
 Patients using low-dose aspirin (LDA) have an increased risk of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of rabeprazole for preventing peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with LDA.METHODS:  Patients with a history of peptic ulcers who were receiving LDA for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive rabeprazole at 10 mg daily, rabeprazole at 20 mg daily, or gefarnate (a cytoprotective anti-ulcer agent) at 50 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the development of gastric and/or duodenal ulcer at 12 weeks. The modified Lanza score (MLS) and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at baseline and at 12 weeks.RESULTS:  The full analysis set comprised 261 patients (rabeprazole 10 mg: n = 87, rabeprazole 20 mg: n = 89, gefarnate 100 mg: n = 85). The cumulative incidences of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 weeks in the 10 mg rabeprazole group, 20 mg rabeprazole group, and gefarnate group were 7.4, 3.7, and 26.7 %, respectively (rabeprazole group 5.5 % vs. gefarnate group 26.7 %, hazard ratio [HR] 0.179; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.082-0.394; p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients with an MLS of ≥1 and erosive esophagitis were significantly lower in the rabeprazole group than in the gefarnate group at 12 weeks (gastric lesions 33.5 vs. 62.4 %, p < 0.0001; duodenal lesions 5.7 vs. 24.7 %, p < 0.0001; erosive esophagitis 5.8 vs. 19.4 %, p < 0.0001). Rabeprazole was significantly more effective than gefarnate for the resolution and prevention of gastrointestinal symptoms (resolution 53.6 vs. 25.0 %, p = 0.017; occurrence 9.2 vs. 28.3 %, p = 0.0026).S:  Rabeprazole is more effective than gefarnate for reducing the risk of recurrence of peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms in LDA users.
 Aspirin use is an effective strategy for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, even at low doses. However, in order to implement aspirin interventions, risk-benefit balances and biologic mechanisms need to be better defined; to further this aim, we used a metabolomics approach.METHODS:  We metabolically profiled 40 healthy, nonsmoking men and women ages 20 to 45 years enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 325 mg aspirin/day over a period of 60 days. Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to comprehensively profile participants' plasma samples after aspirin and placebo interventions.RESULTS:  A total of 363 metabolites, covering most human biochemical pathways, were measured. Compared with placebo-treated participants, plasma concentrations of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (R+S) decreased after aspirin treatment in both men and women (P = 0.005). This signal proved robust during 20-fold random splitting of the data using 80% of the samples in each split. We subsequently performed functional follow-up studies using targeted, enantiospecific detection in human colorectal cancer cell lines and observed an aspirin-induced reduction of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate. We further showed that salicylate, the primary aspirin metabolite, inhibits the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase mediated production of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, thereby providing mechanistic evidence for the clinically observed effects of aspirin on total-2-hydroxyglutarate.S:  Using a metabolomics approach with functional follow-up, we propose that a decrease in the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate may identify an additional mechanism for aspirin or its metabolites in cancer prevention.IMPACT: "IMPACT" Reduction of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate identifies a novel, non-COX-inhibition-mediated mechanism of aspirin.
"INTRODUCTION" Antithrombotic drugs, such as low-dose aspirin (LDA) and clopidogrel, can cause upper gastrointestinal complications.AIM: "AIM" The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a mucosal-protective agent, rebamipide, could prevent gastric mucosal injuries induced by LDA with or without clopidogrel in healthy subjects.: "" A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 32 healthy male volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to a 14-day course of one of the following regimens: group A, placebo (tid) + LDA; group B, rebamipide (100 mg tid) + LDA (100 mg once-daily); group C, placebo + LDA + clopidogrel (75 mg once-daily); or group D, rebamipide + LDA + clopidogrel. The grade of gastric mucosal injuries was evaluated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy before and after dosing (on day 0 and day 14), and the grade of gastric mucosal injury was assessed according to the modified Lanza score. Subjective symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). A rapid urease test was performed on day 0, and blood tests were performed on day 0 and day 14.RESULTS:  Rebamipide significantly inhibited gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel when compared with placebo in healthy subjects. GSRS score and hemoglobin level were not significantly different among the four groups.S:  Rebamipide is useful for the primary prevention of gastric mucosal injury induced by LDA alone or by LDA plus clopidogrel in healthy subjects.
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin is a widely accepted strategy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but this approach is not evidence based. The goal of the present study was to determine whether DAPT in patients undergoing TAVI is associated with improved outcomes compared to aspirin alone. From May 2009 to August 2010, consecutive patients were randomized to receive a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel on the day before TAVI followed by a 3-month maintenance daily dose of 75 mg plus aspirin 100 mg lifelong (DAPT group) or aspirin 100 mg alone (ASA group). The primary end point was the composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, defined as death from any cause, myocardial infarction, major stroke, urgent or emergency conversion to surgery, or life-threatening bleeding. The cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 30 days and 6 months was 14% and 16%, respectively. No significant differences between the DAPT and ASA groups were noted at both 30 days (13% vs 15%, p = 0.71) and 6 months (18% vs 15%; p = 0.85). In conclusion, the strategy of adding clopidogrel to aspirin for 3 months after TAVI was not found to be superior to aspirin alone. These results must be confirmed in a larger randomized trial.
"" To evaluate whether daily enoxaparin, added to low-dose aspirin, started before 14 weeks of gestation reduces placenta-mediated complications in pregnant women with previous severe preeclampsia diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation.METHODS:  In this open-label multicenter randomized trial, we enrolled consenting pregnant women with previous severe preeclampsia diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation, gestational age at randomization of 7-13 weeks, singleton pregnancy, and no plan for anticoagulation. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to a one-to-one ratio to receive daily either 4,000 international units enoxaparin plus 100 mg aspirin or 100 mg aspirin alone. Randomization was done by a web-based randomization system. The primary composite outcome comprised maternal death, perinatal death, preeclampsia, small for gestational age (less than the 10th percentile), and placental abruption. A sample size of 232 women equally divided into two groups was needed to detect a significant reduction in primary outcome from 55% in the aspirin group to 36.7% in the enoxaparin-aspirin group (α: 0.05, β: 0.8, two-sided).RESULTS:  Between November 14, 2009, and February 21, 2015, 257 participants were enrolled. Baseline demographic and clinical factors were similar between groups. Eight women were excluded after randomization (six in the enoxaparin-aspirin group and two in the aspirin group), leaving 124 participants assigned to enoxaparin-aspirin and 125 to aspirin. Five participants were lost to follow-up (two in the enoxaparin-aspirin group and three in the aspirin group). There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary outcome: enoxaparin-aspirin 42 of 122 (34.4%) compared with aspirin alone 50 of 122 (41%) (relative risk 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.61-1.16, P=.29). The occurrence of complications did not differ between the two groups.: "" Antepartum prophylactic enoxaparin does not significantly reduce placenta-mediated complications in women receiving low-dose aspirin for previous severe preeclampsia diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation.
 Recurrent miscarriage is a major women's health problem. Aspirin and heparin have been shown to have potentially beneficial effects on trophoblast implantation. However, few published data on this issue are available from developing countries.METHODS:  An open clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Misurata Teaching Hospital in Libya from January 2009 to December 2010 to investigate the effects of treatment with low dose aspirin (LDA) versus treatment with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) in combination with LDA on patients with a history of recurrent miscarriages. A total of 150 women were enrolled in the study. Women were eligible for the study if they had a history of three or more consecutive miscarriages. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either LDA (75 mg daily) alone or a combination of LDA and LMWH (75 women per treatment group). The primary outcomes were the rate of miscarriages and live births for each group.RESULTS:  Compared with the group who received LDA alone, the combination group had a significantly lower number of miscarriages (22/75 [29%] vs. 43/75 [47%], P < 0.001) and had a significantly higher number of live births (53/75 [71%] vs. 32/75 [42%], P < 0.001). Two preterm infants in the LDA group and three in the combination group were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. There were no significant differences in the mean (SD) birth weights of neonates born in either group (2955.4 ± 560 vs. 3050 ± 540 g for the LDA and combination groups, respectively, P = 0.444). There were no congenital abnormalities detected in either group.: "" The combination of LDA and LMWH is better than LDA alone for the maintenance of pregnancy in patients with recurrent first trimester miscarriage.
The risk-to-benefit ratio for the use of low dose of aspirin in primary cardiovascular (CV) prevention in patients with diabetes mellitus remains to be clarified. We assessed the effect of aspirin on risk of CV events in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy, in order to verify the usefulness of Guidelines in clinical practice. We carried out a prospective multicentric study in 564 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy free of CV disease attending outpatient diabetes clinics . A total of 242 patients received antiplatelet treatment with aspirin 100 mg/day (group A), and 322 were not treated with antiplatelet drugs (group B). Primary end point was the occurrence of total major adverse cardio-vascular events (MACE). Secondary end points were the relative occurrence of fatal MACE. The average follow-up was 8 years. Total MACE occurred in 49 patients from group A and in 52 patients from group B. Fatal MACE occurred in 22 patients from group A and in 20 from group B; nonfatal MACE occurred in 27 patients from group A and in 32 patients from group B. Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show a statistically significant difference of cumulative MACE between the two groups. A not statistically significant difference in the incidence of both fatal (p = 0.225) and nonfatal CV events (p = 0.573) between the two groups was observed. These results were confirmed after adjustment for confounders (HR for MACE 1.11, 95 % CI 0.91-1.35). These findings suggest that low dose of aspirin is ineffective in primary prevention for patients with nephropathy.
 The systematic use of aspirin and statins in patients with diabetes and no previous cardiovascular events is controversial. We sought to assess the effects of aspirin and statins on the thrombotic risk assessed by thrombin generation (TG) among patients with type II diabetes mellitus and no previous cardiovascular events.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: "METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS" Prospective, randomized, open, blinded to events evaluation, controlled, 2×2 factorial clinical trial including 30 patients randomly allocated to aspirin 100 mg/d, atorvastatin 40 mg/d, both or none. Outcome measurements included changes in TG levels after treatment (8 to 10 weeks), assessed by a calibrated automated thrombogram. At baseline all groups had similar clinical and biochemical profiles, including TG levels. There was no interaction between aspirin and atorvastatin. Atorvastatin significantly reduced TG measured as peak TG with saline (85.09±55.34 nmol vs 153.26±75.55 nmol for atorvastatin and control groups, respectively; p = 0.018). On the other hand, aspirin had no effect on TG (121.51±81.83 nmol vs 116.85±67.66 nmol, for aspirin and control groups, respectively; p = 0.716). The effects of treatments on measurements of TG using other agonists were consistent.S/SIGNIFICANCE: "S/SIGNIFICANCE" While waiting for data from ongoing large clinical randomized trials to definitively outline the role of aspirin in primary prevention, our study shows that among diabetic patients without previous vascular events, statins but not aspirin reduce thrombotic risk assessed by TG.
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are often prescribed concurrently in patients with nociceptive pain and cardiovascular comorbidity. NSAIDs and ASA inhibit the same COX-enzymes, and thus may interact. ASA's cardioprotective antiplatelet effect is entirely COX-1 dependent. NSAIDs can be either non-COX-1 and COX-2 selective or COX-2 selective. The aim of this study was to examine the interaction between ASA and different selective and nonselective NSAIDs on thrombocyte function.METHODS:  Single-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, ex vivo, serial crossover trial of 3-day cycles separated by washout periods of at least 12 days in 30 healthy volunteers, evaluating interaction on ASA's antithrombocyte effect by naproxen, ibuprofen, meloxicam, or etoricoxib taken 2 h before ASA. Ex vivo thrombocyte function, closure time (CT) in seconds, was measured using the Platelet Function Analyzer 100 (PFA-100). CT prolongation during a cycle reflects thrombocyte inhibitory effect. ASA nonresponse was defined as CT prolongation <40 % in the placebo cycle. ASA nonresponders were excluded. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used to evaluate NSAID effect on ASA-induced CT prolongation.RESULTS:  Ibuprofen and naproxen inhibit ASA's antithrombocyte effect below the nonresponse threshold. Etoricoxib and meloxicam do not cause relevant change in ASA thrombocyte inhibition. Naproxen has an inherent weak thrombocyte inhibitory action below the ASA response threshold.S:  COX-1 affinity determines the interaction between NSAIDs and ASA on thrombocyte adhesion and aggregation. Ibuprofen and naproxen, but not etoricoxib or meloxicam, taken 2 h before ASA, significantly inhibit ASA's antithrombocyte effect.
"IMPORTANCE" Management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains largely supportive. Whether early intervention can prevent development of ARDS remains unclear.: "" To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early aspirin administration for the prevention of ARDS.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 US academic hospitals. Between January 2, 2012, and November 17, 2014, 7673 patients at risk for ARDS (Lung Injury Prediction Score ≥4) in the emergency department were screened and 400 were randomized. Ten patients were excluded, leaving 390 in the final modified intention-to-treat analysis cohort.INTERVENTIONS: "INTERVENTIONS" Administration of aspirin, 325-mg loading dose followed by 81 mg/d (n = 195) or placebo (n = 195) within 24 hours of emergency department presentation and continued to hospital day 7, discharge, or death.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" The primary outcome was the development of ARDS by study day 7. Secondary measures included ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, 28-day and 1-year survival, and change in serum biomarkers associated with ARDS. A final α level of .0737 (α = .10 overall) was required for statistical significance of the primary outcome.RESULTS:  Among 390 analyzed patients (median age, 57 years; 187 [48%] women), the median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 6 3-10) days. Administration of aspirin, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the incidence of ARDS at 7 days (10.3% vs 8.7%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.24 [92.6% CI, 0.67 to 2.31], P = .53). No significant differences were seen in secondary outcomes: ventilator-free to day 28, mean (SD), 24.9 (7.4) days vs 25.2 (7.0) days (mean [90% CI] difference, -0.26 [-1.46 to 0.94] days; P = .72); ICU length of stay, mean (SD), 5.2 (7.0) days vs 5.4 (7.0) days (mean [90% CI] difference, -0.16 [-1.75 to 1.43] days; P = .87); hospital length of stay, mean (SD), 8.8 (10.3) days vs 9.0 (9.9) days (mean [90% CI] difference, -0.27 [-1.96 to 1.42] days; P = .79); or 28-day survival, 90% vs 90% (hazard ratio [90% CI], 1.03 [0.60 to 1.79]; P = .92) or 1-year survival, 73% vs 75% (hazard ratio [90% CI], 1.06 [0.75 to 1.50]; P = .79). Bleeding-related adverse events were infrequent in both groups (aspirin vs placebo, 5.6% vs 2.6%; odds ratio [90% CI], 2.27 [0.92 to 5.61]; P = .13).RESULTS:  Among 390 analyzed patients (median age, 57 years; 187 [48%] women), median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 6 (3-10) days. Administration of aspirin, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the incidence of ARDS at 7 days (OR, 1.24; 92.6%CI, 0.67-2.31). No significant differences were seen in secondary outcomes or adverse events. [table: see text]S AND RELEVANCE: "S AND RELEVANCE" Among at-risk patients presenting to the ED, the use of aspirin compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of ARDS at 7 days. The findings of this phase 2b trial do not support continuation to a larger phase 3 trial.
"" To analyze the effects of preoperative uses of aspirin and clopidogrel on perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirements and complication in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).METHODS:  At our hospital from October 2011 to October 2012, a total of 480 patients underwent off-pump CABG performed by the same surgical team. Among them, 198 patients continued aspirin (discontinued clopidogrel at least 5 days) through operation (aspirin group, 1), 53 had aspirin and clopidogrel until 3 days before surgery (aspirin and clopidogrel group, 2) and 229 discontinued antiplatelet therapy 5 more days before surgery (control group, 3).RESULTS:  No significant difference of basic clinical characteristics existed among three groups (P > 0.05). Group 2 was associated with a greater volume of chest tube drainage than other groups (827 ± 216 vs 416 ± 135 vs 265 ± 85 ml, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 3, even though chest tube drainage volume of group 1 was greater (827 ± 216vs 265 ± 85 ml, P > 0.05). There was no instance of stroke, myocardial infarction or post-operative mortality.: "" Preoperative clopidogrel exposure within 5 days of surgery increases perioperative blood loss. And the pre-operative use of aspirin results in no difference in postoperative perioperative blood loss and cardiovascular outcomes.
"S" The effect of aspirin upon platelet function is well documented although experimental studies suggest that aspirin may also affect oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and dysglycaemia. The optimal dose of aspirin for cardiovascular protection in type 2 diabetes is still debated. We examined the effects of different doses of aspirin upon these novel markers of cardiovascular risk and any association between aspirin-mediated changes in these markers.METHODOLOGY: "METHODOLOGY" Subjects with type 2 diabetes attended for baseline evaluation including BMI, glycaemic and lipid markers, endothelial function (photoplethysmography), insulin resistance (HOMA), inflammation (sVCAM-1 and Hs-CRP) and markers of oxidative stress [total anti-oxidant status (TAOS and FRAP), whole blood total glutathione (GSH) assays]. Subjects then received in random, sequential, blinded fashion aspirin 75 mg day(-1) , aspirin 300 mg day(-1) , aspirin 3.6 g day(-1) or placebo for 2 weeks with a 2-week washout. The above investigations were repeated after each intervention. Aspirin-related changes compared with placebo were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.RESULTS:  Subjects = 17 (M - 12; F - 5), mean age - 57.4 ± 9.1 years (mean ± 1 SD), HbA1c - 63 ± 13 mmol mol(-1) (7.9 ± 1.2%), total cholesterol 4.57 ± 1.01 mmol l(-1) . At baseline TAOS value was 59.3 ± 9.7 μM AEAC (Ascorbate Equivalent Anti-oxidant Concentration), glutathione 302.2 ± 183.3 mmol l(-1) and FRAP 0.86 ± 0.23 mM FeII. None of the aspirin doses had a significant impact upon BMI, blood pressure, lipid parameters, insulin sensitivity (HOMA), FRAP, TAOS, GSH, endothelial function, glycaemic control (fructosamine) or inflammation (sVCAM-1 and HsCRP).S:  Aspirin exhibited no significant dose-dependent effect on markers of vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and endothelial function (photoplethysmography) when used in type 2 diabetes over a 2-week period.

Treatment to prevent progressive neurological deficits in acute penetrating artery infarction (API) is clinically important, but has not yet been established. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of argatroban, aspirin, and clopidogrel combination therapy for API. Patients with API (lacunar infarcts or branch atheromatous disease) admitted within 48 hours after onset were enrolled. We assigned them to argatroban, aspirin, and clopidogrel (AAC) group or argatroban and aspirin (AA) group. In both groups, blood pressure was controlled to near or below 180/105 mmHg in the admission period. We defined progressing stroke as a worsening of two or more points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on the seventh day of admission. Fifty-four patients were enrolled. We assigned 28 patients to the AAC group, and 26 patients to the AA group. There were no significant differences in background factors between the two groups. The incidence of progressing stroke was significantly higher in the AA group (P<0.05). Intracranial hemorrhage or any other bleeding was not seen in the admission period in either group. Our findings suggest that the AAC combination therapy may positively affect progressive neurological deficits in API patients.
 There is a body of evidence indicating that aspirin may reduce the risk of cancer mortality. However, to the authors' knowledge, the optimal exposure timing and mechanism of action remain unclear. In the current study, the authors investigated associations between prediagnostic aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality in a US population.METHODS:  Postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer (1993-2009) were identified (2925 women with a total of 18,073 person-years) from the National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Prediagnostic aspirin use (1274 women) was identified from study questionnaires. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality. Effect modification by lymph node status was evaluated.RESULTS:  Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68-1.31 [P = .74]). In analyses stratified by lymph node status, aspirin use was found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality among women with lymph node-negative tumors (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93 [P = 0.02]), but not those with lymph node-positive tumors (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92-2.16 [P = 0.11]). Tests for interaction were found to be statistically significant (P for interaction =.006). No association was noted between aspirin use and lymph node status.S:  Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality overall. However, effect modification by lymph node status was observed and mortality was found to be reduced by approximately one-half among aspirin users with lymph node-negative disease. This represents a clinically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. These findings contribute to the understanding of aspirin's mechanism of action in breast cancer. However, further etiologic research to understand this association is warranted. Cancer 2016;122:2067-75. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
Resolution of inflammation is an active process involving specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) formed from the n-3 fatty acids. This study examined the effect of n-3 fatty acid supplementation and aspirin on plasma SPMs in healthy humans. Healthy volunteers (n = 21) were supplemented with n-3 fatty acids (2.4g/day) for 7 days with random assignment to take aspirin (300 mg/day) or placebo from day 5 to day 7. Blood was collected at baseline (day 0), day 5, and day 7. Plasma 18R/S-HEPE, E-series resolvins, 17R/S-HDHA, D-series resolvins, 14R/S-HDHA, and MaR-1 were measured by LC/MS/MS. At baseline concentrations of E- and D- series resolvins and the upstream precursors 18R/S-HEPE, 17R/S-HDHA ranged from 0.1nM to 0.2nM. 14R/S-HDHA was 3-fold higher than the other SPMs at baseline but MaR-1 was below the limit of detection. Supplementation with n-3 fatty acids significantly increased RvE1, 18R/S-HEPE, 17R/S-HDHA, and 14R/S-HDHA but not other SPMs. The addition of aspirin after 5 days of n-3 fatty acids did not affect concentrations of any SPM. N-3 fatty acid supplementation for 5 days results in concentrations of SPMs that are biologically active in healthy humans. Aspirin administered after n-3 fatty acids did not offer any additional benefit in elevating the levels of SPMs. 
 A recent meta-analysis showed that aspirin was associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. As anti-inflammatory medications lower PSA levels, whether these findings reflect reduced prostate cancer detection or lower prostate cancer risk is unknown. We tested the association between aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID use on prostate cancer diagnosis in REDUCE, where all men received biopsies at 2 and 4 years largely independent of PSA. REDUCE tested dutasteride for prostate cancer risk reduction in men with a PSA of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative prestudy biopsy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN" We examined the association between aspirin, NSAIDs, or both and total, low-grade (Gleason < 7), or high-grade (Gleason ≥ 7) prostate cancer versus no prostate cancer using multinomial logistic regression among 6,390 men who underwent ≥1 on-study biopsy. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, race, geographic region, PSA, prostate volume, digital rectal examination, body mass index, treatment arm, smoking, alcohol, statins, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.RESULTS:  Overall, 3,169 men (50%) were nonusers, 1,368 (21%) used aspirin, 1,176 (18%) used NSAIDs, and 677 (11%) used both. In unadjusted models, aspirin was associated with reduced prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.85, P = 0.036). In multivariable analyses, aspirin was associated with reduced total prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.81, P = 0.015). Use of NSAIDs or NSAIDs and aspirin was not associated with total, low-grade, or high-grade prostate cancer, though all ORs were <1 (all P ≥ 0.08). Therefore, we created a dichotomous variable of aspirin and/or NSAID users versus nonusers. On multivariable analysis, the use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was significantly associated with decreased total (OR = 0.87, P = 0.030) and high-grade (OR = 0.80, P = 0.040), but not with low-grade, prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.90, P = 0.15). Results were similar in placebo and dutasteride arms.S:  Among men with a negative biopsy, aspirin and/or NSAID use was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk. Additional studies are warranted.
 Coronary artery disease remains the dominant cause of mortality in developed countries. While platelets have been recognized to play a pivotal role in atherothrombosis, the ideal antiplatelet regime after coronary artery surgery remains elusive. The evolution of CABG has presently moved beyond technical improvements to involve modulation of pharmacologic management designed to improve patient outcomes. The aim of this trial will be to test the hypothesis that the addition of clopidogrel to patients with documented postoperative aspirin resistance will reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events.METHODS:  Patients scheduled for isolated coronary artery surgery will be eligible for the study. Patients in whom postoperative multiple electrode aggregometry documents aspirin resistance will be randomized into two groups. The control group will receive 300 mg of aspirin. The dual antiplatelet group will receive 75 mg of clopidogrel in addition to 300 mg of aspirin. Patients will be followed for 6 months. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization due to cardiovascular pathology) as well as bleeding events will be recorded.
"" To investigate the curative effect and safety of buyang huanwu decoction (BHD) combined aspirin (ASP) in treatment of aspirin resistance (AR) patients at transient ischemic attack (TIA).METHODS:  Recruited were 86 AR patients at TIA who took ASP as the secondary prevention. Two cases were rejected due to poor compliance. The rest 84 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group. Those in the treatment group were treated with BHD and ASP, while those in the control group took Clopidogrel and ASP. After 30-, 60-, and 90-day of treatment, arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet aggregation rate (PAG) were detected using turbidimetry. After treatment of 90 days, the case numbers of TIA recurrence or of progressing to cerebral infarction were counted. The incidence of adverse events was also observed.RESULTS:  The ADP-and AA-induced PAG showed similar decreasing tendency in the treatment group and the control group at each time point (P >0.05). There was no statistical difference in the risk control of end point events (including ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, TIA recurrence, cerebral infarction) between the two groups (P >0.05). One patient suffered from bleeding (mild gastrointestinal bleeding) in the treatment group, while 4 patients suffered from bleeding (3 due to skin and mucous membrane bleeding and 1 to stool bleeding). The bleeding risk was lowered by 76.29% in the treatment group when compared with the control group.S:  BHD combined ASP showed similar efficacy in treating AR and controlling endpoint events. Besides, they lowered bleeding risk.
Preeclampsia is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have tested calcium supplementation and aspirin separately to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia but not the effects of combined supplementation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of aspirin combined with calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was carried out at the antenatal clinic of a large university hospital in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. A total of 49 women with chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20-27 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 26) or 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium (N = 23) daily until delivery. The main outcome of this pilot study was development of superimposed preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The rate of superimposed preeclampsia was 28.6% lower among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in the placebo group (52.2 vs 73.1%, respectively, P=0.112). The rate of fetal growth restriction was reduced by 80.8% in the supplemented group (25 vs 4.8% in the placebo vs supplemented groups, respectively; P=0.073). The rate of preterm birth was 33.3% in both groups. The combined supplementation of aspirin and calcium starting at 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant decrease in the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in hypertensive women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler.
 Aspirin is a widely used NSAID that has been extensively studied in numerous conditions. Nonprescription analgesics, such as aspirin, are frequently used for a wide variety of common ailments, including conditions such as dental pain and tension-type headache.: "" We sought to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of aspirin, acetaminophen with codeine, and placebo in the treatment of post-operative dental pain and tension-type headache.METHODS:  These were 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose clinical trials that assigned participants (2:2:1) to receive either aspirin (1000 mg), acetaminophen (300 mg) with codeine (30 mg), or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the sum of pain intensity differences from baseline (SPID) over 6 hours for the dental pain study and over 4 hours for the tension-type headache study. Other common analgesic measures, in addition to safety, were also evaluated.RESULTS:  The results of the dental pain study for aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine suggest statistically significant efficacy for all measures compared with placebo at all time points. Aspirin provided statistically significant efficacy compared with acetaminophen with codeine for SPID(0-4) (P = 0.028). In the tension-type headache study, aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine provided statistically significant efficacy compared with placebo for SPID(0-4) and SPID(0-6) (P < 0.001) and for total pain relief (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine at any evaluation of SPID (P ≥ 0.070), complete relief (P ≥ 0.179), or time to meaningful relief (P ≥ 0.245). Regarding safety, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events in the dental pain and tension-type headache studies.S:  These 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that treatment with aspirin (1000 mg) provides statistically significant analgesic efficacy compared with placebo use and comparable efficacy with acetaminophen (300 mg) with codeine (30 mg) therapy after impacted third molar extraction and in tension- type headache.
"INTRODUCTION" Perioperative Ischaemic Evaluation-2 (POISE-2) is an international 2×2 factorial randomised controlled trial of low-dose aspirin versus placebo and low-dose clonidine versus placebo in patients who undergo non-cardiac surgery. Perioperative aspirin (and possibly clonidine) may reduce the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI).METHODS AND ANALYSIS: "METHODS AND ANALYSIS" After receipt of grant funding, serial postoperative serum creatinine measurements began to be recorded in consecutive patients enrolled at substudy participating centres. With respect to the study schedule, the last of over 6500 substudy patients from 82 centres in 21 countries were randomised in December 2013. The authors will use logistic regression to estimate the adjusted OR of AKI following surgery (compared with the preoperative serum creatinine value, a postoperative increase ≥26.5 μmol/L in the 2 days following surgery or an increase of ≥50% in the 7 days following surgery) comparing each intervention to placebo, and will report the adjusted relative risk reduction. Alternate definitions of AKI will also be considered, as will the outcome of AKI in subgroups defined by the presence of preoperative chronic kidney disease and preoperative chronic aspirin use. At the time of randomisation, a subpopulation agreed to a single measurement of serum creatinine between 3 and 12 months after surgery, and the authors will examine intervention effects on this outcome.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: "ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION" The authors were competitively awarded a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research for this POISE-2 AKI substudy. Ethics approval was obtained for additional kidney data collection in consecutive patients enrolled at participating centres, which first began for patients enrolled after January 2011. In patients who provided consent, the remaining longer term serum creatinine data will be collected throughout 2014. The results of this study will be reported no later than 2015.
 Pharmaceutical inhibition of host response pathways may be an adjunctive or alternative strategy for treating periodontal diseases. In addition to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, aspirin is known to modify the action of cyclo-oxygenase, changing its activity to a lipoxygenase and leading to formation of lipoxins which have a proresolving effect. This study evaluated the periodontal attachment level of subjects on long-term low dose aspirin therapy.METHODS:  Oral hygiene index simplified, clinical attachment loss and bleeding index were recorded for 162 subjects who were on long-term (>6 months) low dose (75 mg and 150 mg) aspirin therapy (study group) and 146 subjects not taking the drug (control group).RESULTS:  Mean clinical attachment loss was 2.38 ± 0.49 mm in the control group and 2.01 ± 0.69 mm in the study group. The difference was statistically significant at p < 0.001. Correlation analysis suggested that there was a negative correlation between clinical attachment loss and duration of aspirin intake but the clinical attachment loss was not significantly different in the two dosage groups.S:  The results of this study suggest that low dose aspirin may reduce the risk of periodontal attachment loss. This hypothesis needs to be tested by larger sample sized prospective cohort studies.
 Population-based studies on aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) are very few, and no previous population study has investigated risk factors for the condition.: "" To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of AIA in the general population.METHODS:  A questionnaire on respiratory health was mailed to 30,000 randomly selected subjects aged 16-75 years in West Sweden, 29,218 could be traced and 18,087 (62%) responded. The questionnaire included questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms, aspirin-induced dyspnoea and possible determinants.RESULTS:  The prevalence of AIA was 0.5%, 0.3% in men and 0.6% in women (P = 0.014). Sick leave, emergency visits due to asthma and all investigated lower respiratory symptoms were more common in AIA than in aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA). Obesity was a strong risk factor for AIA (BMI > 35: odds ratio (OR) 12.1; 95% CI 2.49-58.5), and there was a dose-response relationship between increasing body mass index (BMI) and risk of AIA. Obesity, airborne occupational exposure and visible mould at home were considerably stronger risk factors for AIA than for ATA. Current smoking was a risk factor for AIA (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.47-4.42), but not ATA.: "" Aspirin-intolerant asthma identified in the general population was associated with a high burden of symptoms, uncontrolled disease and a high morbidity. Increasing BMI increased the risk of AIA in a dose-response manner. A number of risk factors, including obesity and current smoking, were considerably stronger for AIA than for ATA.
 Antiplatelet therapy may attenuate the undesirable effects of platelets on the inflammatory cascades in critical illness. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between aspirin therapy during intensive care unit (ICU) stay and all-cause mortality.METHODS:  This was a nested cohort study within two randomized controlled trials in which all enrolled patients (N = 763) were grouped according to aspirin intake during ICU stay. The primary endpoints were all-cause ICU mortality and hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included the development of severe sepsis during the ICU stay, ICU and hospital length of stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Propensity score was used to adjust for clinically and statistically relevant variables.RESULTS:  Of the 763 patients, 154 patients (20 %) received aspirin. Aspirin therapy was not associated with a reduction in ICU mortality (adjusted OR 1.18, 95 % CI 0.69-2.02, P = 0.55) nor with hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.61-1.50, P = 0.82). Aspirin use had no preferential association with mortality among any of the study subgroups. Additionally, aspirin therapy was associated with higher risk of ICU-acquired severe sepsis, and increased mechanical ventilation duration and ICU length of stay.: "" Our study showed that the use of aspirin in critically ill patients was not associated with lower mortality, but rather with an increased morbidity.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: "TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER" ISRCTN07413772 and ISRCTN96294863 .
"BACKGROUND/S" The effect of aspirin and clopidogrel in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) on platelet function was compared with separate formulations in patients that had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES).METHODS:  This was a phase IV, prospective, multicenter, single-arm, non-inferiority study. Patients that had taken aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily as separate formulations for >6 months after PCI with DES were enrolled, and then switched to an aspirin/clopidogrel FDC once-daily for 4 weeks. Platelet reactivity was determined using the VerifyNow® P2Y12 assay at baseline (immediately prior to switching) and 4 weeks later.RESULTS:  A total of 648 patients (the full-analysis population; age, 63.6±9.0 years; male, 76.5%) finished the study, and 565 (the per-protocol population) completed without protocol violations. In the per-protocol population, the % inhibitions of P2Y12 and ARU were not significantly different between baseline and after 4 weeks of FDC treatment (29.2±20.0% to 29.0±19.9%, P=0.708; 445.1±69.2 to 446.2±63.0, P=0.799, respectively) and the difference in P2Y12 inhibition observed did not exceed the predetermined limit of non-inferiority (95% CI, -0.9 to 1.3). In the full-analysis population, the % inhibitions of P2Y12, PRU, and ARU were not significantly changed after 4 weeks of FDC treatment.S:  This study demonstrates that the efficacy of platelet inhibition by an aspirin/clopidogrel FDC was not inferior to that of separate aspirin and clopidogrel formulations in patients that had undergone PCI with DES.
 To determine the effect of aspirin on ulcer healing rate in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, and to establish prognostic factors that influence ulcer evolution.METHODS:  Between 2001 and 2005, 78 patients with ulcerated lesions of diameter >2 cm and associated with chronic venous insufficiency were evaluated in our hospital. Of these, 51 patients (22 men, 29 women) with mean age of 60 years (range: 36-86) were included in a prospective randomized trial with a parallel control group. The treatment group received 300 mg of aspirin and the control group received no drug treatment; in both groups, healing was associated with standard compression therapy. During follow-up, held weekly in a blinded fashion, there was ulcer healing as well as cases of recurrence. Results were analyzed by intention-to-treat approach. Cure rate was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the influence of prognostic factors was analyzed by applying the Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS:  In the presence of gradual compression therapy, healing occurred more rapidly in patients receiving aspirin versus the control subjects (12 weeks in the treated group vs. 22 weeks in the control group), with a 46% reduction in healing time. The main prognostic factor was estimated initial area of injury (P = 0.032). Age, sex, systemic therapy, and infection showed little relevance to evolution.S:  The administration of aspirin daily dose of 300 mg shortens the healing time of ulcerated lesions in the chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The main prognostic factor for healing of venous ulcerated lesions is the initial surface area of the ulcer.
 Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy reduces stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increases hemorrhage.: "" To quantify the net benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy, accounting for differences in clinical significance between ischemic and hemorrhagic events.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Observational cohort study to assign the relative weighting of events and post hoc analysis of randomized trial data to assess net benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) clinical trials.SETTING: "SETTING" Global randomized clinical trial.PATIENTS: "PATIENTS" 10,041 patients with AF, 7554 of whom were not candidates for warfarin therapy.MEASUREMENTS: "MEASUREMENTS" Ischemic events (ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or subdural or extracranial bleeding), weighted by the hazard ratio for death (or death or disability) after an event relative to death (or death or disability) after ischemic stroke. The net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE A trial participants was defined as the sum of weighted event incidence with dual antiplatelet therapy subtracted from the sum of weighted event incidence on control treatment, expressed as ischemic stroke equivalents prevented per 100 patients years.RESULTS:  Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy prevented 0.57 ischemic stroke equivalent (95% CI, -0.12 to 1.24) per 100 patient-years of treatment when weighted by hazard for death after ischemia or hemorrhage and 0.67 ischemic stroke equivalent (CI, -0.03 to 1.18) when weighted by death or disability after ischemia or hemorrhage.LIMITATION: "LIMITATION" No attempt was made to relate deaths used for weighting to events; disability data were missing for more than one half of patients.: "" Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy resulted in a modest net benefit among patients with AF for whom warfarin was unsuitable. The benefit would probably be clinically relevant for some patients, but estimates could not exclude the possibility of either no benefit or very small harm in this population.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: "PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE" Bristol-Myers Squibb and sanofi-aventis.
Aspirin resistance or aspirin non-responsiveness is a recently described phenomenon which has been consistently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This study was designed to determine the effects of an additional dose of 100 mg of aspirin on platelet function and proportion of aspirin non-responders using the platelet function analyzer-100 (PFA-100), in a well characterized population of stable coronary heart disease patients already on long-term aspirin treatment. Platelet function was assessed using PFA-100 in 141 patients (64.8 ± 10.1 years, 87.9% men) on long-term aspirin treatment (100 mg/day) before and 1 h after "in site" oral aspirin administration (100 mg). Prevalence of aspirin non-responders using PFA-100 was 50.7% (95% confidence interval 42.4-59). One hour after 100 mg of oral aspirin, reassessment of aspirin effects showed a prevalence of non-responders using PFA of 35.0% (95% CI 27.3-43.2) (P < 0.001 vs. pre-dose proportion). Using the PFA-100 system, reassessment of platelet function following oral administration of daily aspirin dosage significantly reduces the number of stable coronary disease patients considered to be non-responders to such treatment.
The efficacy of low-dose aspirin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been questioned. We tested if twice daily dosing of aspirin would be more effective in T2DM, possibly due to increased platelet turnover. A randomised cross-over study compared 75 mg aspirin OD, 75 mg BID and 320 mg OD (≥ 2 week treatment periods) in 25 patients with T2DM and micro- or macrovascular complications. Platelet responses were examined by impedance aggregometry (WBA) and the IMPACT-R aspirin test in whole blood, light transmittance aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma (LTA), and urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (TxM). Aspirin 75 mg BID decreased arachidonic acid (AA)-induced WBA compared to 75 mg OD (9.7 ± 4.5 vs. 12.6 ± 3.5 ohm; p = 0.003) or to 320 mg OD (11.5 ± 4.2 Ohms; p = 0.049). WBA responses to collagen were similarly attenuated by BID or high dosing (by 12-14%; p = 0.02 for both). The IMPACT-R showed a better response to 75 mg BID compared to 75 mg OD (p = 0.049), but not to 320 mg OD. AA-induced aggregation by LTA was <6.5% on all occasions, with no differences between aspirin dosages. TxM was reduced after 320 mg OD (p = 0.002), but not 75 mg BID (p = 0.07). Reticulated platelets were highly correlated with mean platelet volume (MPV; r2 = 0.74, p<0.0001). Both markers for platelet turnover were correlated with AA-induced WBA, but neither identified patients who benefited from BID dosing dependably. In conclusion, twice daily dosing improved laboratory responses to aspirin in high risk T2DM patients. Studies of whether BID dosing of aspirin can improve clinical outcomes in such patients are of interest.
 Low-dose aspirin seems to offer no benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The anti-platelet effect may be diminished by poor glycemic control or inadequate dosing of aspirin.S: "S" To study the effects of both glycemic control and increasing aspirin dose on platelet response to aspirin in DM2 patients and matched controls.PATIENTS/METHODS: "PATIENTS/METHODS" Platelet effects of increasing doses of aspirin (30, 100 and 300 mg daily) were prospectively assessed in 94 DM2 patients and 25 matched controls by measuring thromboxane levels in urine (11-dhTxB2) and platelet aggregation using VerifyNow(®) and light transmission aggregometry (LTA). DM2 patients were stratified for glycemic control (hemoglobin-A1c [HbA1c] ≤ 53, 53-69, ≥ 69 mmol mol(-1)).RESULTS:  At baseline, median 11-dhTxB2 excretion was higher in the poorly controlled patients (77 ng mmol(-1)), and the moderately controlled (84 ng mmol(-1)) compared with the well-controlled patients (64 ng mmol(-1)) and controls (53 ng mmol(-1)), P < 0.01. Next, 30 mg of aspirin reduced 11-dhTxB2 excretion to 31, 29 and 24 ng mmol(-1) in the poorly, moderately and well-controlled patients, respectively, and to 19 ng mmol(-1) in controls, P < 0.001. VerifyNow(®) and LTA were also incompletely suppressed in DM2 patients using 30 mg of aspirin, but 100 mg resulted in similar platelet suppression in all groups, with no additional effect of 300 mg.S:  DM2 patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c > 53 mmol mol(-1)) have higher baseline platelet activity and incomplete suppression of platelet activity with 30 mg of aspirin. However, 100 mg of aspirin leads to optimal inhibition irrespective of glycemic control, and 300 mg does not further improve platelet suppression.
 Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are the commonest cause of leg ulceration, affecting 1 in 100 adults. There is a significant health burden associated with VLUs - it is estimated that the cost of treatment for 1 ulcer is up to £1300 per year in the NHS. The mainstay of treatment is with graduated compression bandaging; however, treatment is often prolonged and up to one quarter of venous leg ulcers do not heal despite standard care. Two previous trials have suggested that low-dose aspirin, as an adjunct to standard care, may hasten healing, but these trials were small and of poor quality. Aspirin is an inexpensive, widely used medication but its safety and efficacy in the treatment of VLUs remains to be established.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" AVURT is a phase II randomised double blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled efficacy trial. The primary objective is to examine whether aspirin, in addition to standard care, is effective in patients with chronic VLUs (i.e. over 6 weeks in duration or a history of VLU). Secondary objectives include feasibility and safety of aspirin in this population. A target of 100 participants, identified from community leg ulcer clinics and hospital clinics, will be randomised to receive either 300 mg of aspirin once daily or placebo. All participants will receive standard care with compression therapy. The primary outcome will be time to healing of the reference ulcer. Follow-up will occur for a maximum of 27 weeks. The primary analysis will use a Cox proportional hazards model to compare time to healing using the principles of intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes will include ulcer size, pain evaluation, compliance and adverse events.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" The AVURT trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as a treatment for VLU and will inform on the feasibility of proceeding to a larger phase III study. This study will address the paucity of information currently available regarding aspirin therapy to treat VLU.
 In the general population, increased adiposity is a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether obesity has similar effects in those with hereditary CRC is uncertain. This prospective study investigated the association between body mass index and cancer risk in patients with Lynch syndrome (LS).PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Participants with LS were recruited to the CAPP2 study, in which they were randomly assigned to receive aspirin 600 mg per day or aspirin placebo, plus resistant starch 30 g per day or starch placebo (2 × 2 factorial design). Mean intervention period was 25.0 months, and mean follow-up was 55.7 months.RESULTS:  During follow-up, 55 of 937 participants developed CRC. For obese participants, CRC risk was 2.41× (95% CI, 1.22 to 4.85) greater than for underweight and normal-weight participants (reference group), and CRC risk increased by 7% for each 1-kg/m(2) increase in body mass index. The risk of all LS-related cancers in obese people was 1.77× (95% CI, 1.06 to 2.96; P = .03) greater than for the reference group. In subgroup analysis, obesity was associated with 3.72× (95% CI, 1.41 to 9.81) greater CRC risk in patients with LS with MLH1 mutation, but no excess risk was observed in those with MSH2 or MSH6 mutation (P = .5). The obesity-related excess CRC risk was confined to those randomly assigned to the aspirin placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.79; P = .03).: "" Obesity is associated with substantially increased CRC risk in patients with LS, but this risk is abrogated in those taking aspirin. Such patients are likely to benefit from obesity prevention and/or regular aspirin.
"INTRODUCTION" Aspirin's effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular disease events is inadequate in some individuals, a phenomenon termed aspirin "resistance". The hypothesis that combining low dose aspirin with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) reduces platelet function in the acute setting has not been investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We conducted a clinical trial of EPA+DHA and aspirin ingestion in healthy adults. Fasting blood samples were drawn at baseline and 4 h after supplementation with EPA/DHA (3.4 g/d), aspirin (81 mg), and both. Platelet function was measured using the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100). Plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), autotaxin, angiogenesis activators, and cytokines were measured.RESULTS:  Platelet function decreased with the combination of aspirin+EPA/DHA (p=0.03) but not with either alone (p>0.05). EPA-LPC increased (p=0.002).DISCUSSION AND S: "DISCUSSION AND S" Our results demonstrate that a potentially beneficial effect on platelet function occurred within 4h after ingestion of low-dose aspirin and EPA+DHA in healthy adults.
"S" To determine if clopidogrel administration is associated with a reduced likelihood of recurrent cardiogenic arterial thromboembolism (CATE) in cats compared to aspirin administration. Secondary aims were to determine if clopidogrel administration had an effect on the composite endpoint of recurrent CATE and cardiac death and to identify adverse effects of chronic clopidogrel or aspirin therapy.ANIMALS: "ANIMALS" Seventy-five cats that survived a CATE event.METHODS:  Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, positive-controlled study. Cats were assigned to clopidogrel (18.75 mg/cat PO q 24 h) or aspirin (81 mg/cat PO q 72 h). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for each endpoint and the log rank test performed to compare treatment groups with respect to time to event and the likelihood of the event occurring.RESULTS:  The mean age of all cats was 8.0 ± 3.5 yr and 57/75 (76%) were male (p < 0.001); 62/75 (83%) were mixed breed with the remainder including Persian, Abyssinian, American Shorthair, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Snowshoe, and Sphynx breeds. Only 15% (11/75) of cats had a history of heart disease recorded prior to the CATE event. Clopidogrel administration was associated with significantly reduced likelihood of recurrent CATE compared to aspirin (p = 0.024) and had a longer median time to recurrence [443 (95% CI 185-990) days vs. 192 (95% CI 62-364) days, respectively]. Clopidogrel was also associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of the composite endpoint of recurrent CATE or cardiac death (p = 0.033) with a longer median time to event [346 (95% CI 146-495) days vs. 128 (95% CI 58-243) days].S:  Clopidogrel administration significantly reduces the likelihood of recurrent CATE compared with aspirin in cats; both drugs were well tolerated.
"BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS" Chemopreventive strategies might be used to reduce the recurrence of colorectal adenomas and the incidence of colorectal cancer. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether a combination of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), calcitriol, and calcium carbonate could prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence.METHODS:  We included 1107 patients with 1 or more sporadic adenoma(s) removed from the colon or rectum at centers in Europe, Russia, or the United States, from 2004 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were 1 adenoma greater than 1 cm in diameter, more than 1 adenoma of any size, or an adenoma of any size and first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given 0.5 μg calcitriol, 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid, and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (n = 209), or placebo (n = 218), each day for 3 years. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence assessed by colonoscopy after 3 years. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with advanced adenomas, the total number of colorectal adenomas, and adenoma size and features.RESULTS:  The trial was stopped in October 2010 because of futility. In this analysis, we found no differences between groups in the rate of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.48), adverse effects, or secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that the treatment effects may be influenced by smoking status (nonsmokers OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.26-1.22 vs current smokers OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.70-4.09; P value interaction < .05). However, the overall interaction was not significant.
ᅟ: We investigated the occurrence of bleeding complications in patients who underwent skin tumor surgery and compared it between Aspirin users and a placebo control group. In this double blind randomized controlled trial, 32 patients who continued taking aspirin (intervention group) and 38 patients who stopped taking Aspirin (placebo group) before surgery were compared in terms of intraoprative and postoperative bleeding problems, hematoma and local signs of coagulopathy. There was no statistically significant difference in intraoprative bleeding between the study groups (P = 0.107). We concluded that continuation of Aspirin therapy had no significant effect on bleeding complications in patients who underwent skin tumor surgery.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" IRCT201602049768N5 Flow chart of the study process and its final finding.
 Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a leading cause of disability in the elderly. Low-grade inflammation and microvessel pathology may be responsible for initiating or exacerbating some of the hearing loss associated with aging. A growing body of evidence demonstrates an association of hearing loss with cognitive decline. A shared etiological pathway may include a role of inflammation, alongside vascular determinants. The ASPREE-HEARING study aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin decreases the progression of ARHL, and if so, whether this decrease in progression is also associated with retinal microvascular changes and/or greater preservation of cognitive function.DESIGN AND METHODS: "DESIGN AND METHODS" A three year double-blind, randomized controlled trial of oral 100mg enteric-coated aspirin or matching placebo, enrolling 1262 Australians aged ≥70years with normal cognitive function and no overt cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome is the change in mean pure tone average hearing threshold (decibels) in the better ear, over a 3-year period. Secondary outcomes consist of changes in retinal microvascular indicators, and changes in cognitive function. Participants are recruited from a larger trial, ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE), which is designed to assess whether daily low dose aspirin will extend disability-free life.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" ASPREE-HEARING will determine whether aspirin slows development or progression of ARHL, and will interrogate the relationship between inflammatory and microvascular mechanisms that may underlie the effects of aspirin on ARHL. This study will improve understanding of the patterns of comorbidity with, and the relationships between, aging and ARHL, alongside modeling the impacts of ARHL.
 There are often disparities between current evidence and current practice. Decreasing the gap between desired practice outcomes and observed practice outcomes in the healthcare system is not always easy. Stopping previously recommended or variably recommended interventions may be even harder to achieve than increasing the use of a desired but under-performed activity. For over a decade, aspirin has been prescribed for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and for patients with the coronary artery disease risk equivalents; yet, there is no substantial evidence of an appropriate risk-benefit ratio to support this practice. This paper describes the protocol of a randomized trial being conducted in six primary care practices in the Denver metropolitan area to examine the effectiveness of three interventional strategies to change physician behavior regarding prescription of low-dose aspirin.METHODS:  All practices received academic detailing, one arm received clinician reminders to reconsider aspirin, a second arm received both clinician and patient messages to reconsider aspirin. The intervention will run for 15 to 18 months. Data collected at baseline and for outcomes from an electronic health record will be used to assess pre- and post-interventional prescribing, as well as to explore any inappropriate decrease in aspirin use by patients with known cardiovascular disease.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This study was designed to investigate effective methods of changing physician behavior to decrease the use of aspirin for primary cardiovascular disease prevention. The results of this study will contribute to the small pool of knowledge currently available on the topic of ceasing previously supported practices.
 Aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with improved breast cancer survival in several prospective studies.METHODS:  We conducted a nested case-control study of ASA use after a breast cancer diagnosis among women using Swedish National Registries. We assessed prospectively recorded ASA exposure during several different time windows following cancer diagnosis using conditional logistic regression with breast cancer death as the main outcome. Within each six-month period of follow-up, we categorized dispensed ASA doses into three groups: 0, less than 1, and 1 or more daily doses.RESULTS:  We included 27,426 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2009; 1,661 died of breast cancer when followed until Dec 31, 2010. There was no association between ASA use and breast cancer death when exposure was assessed either shortly after diagnosis, or 3-12 months before the end of follow-up. Only during the period 0-6 months before the end of follow-up was ASA use at least daily compared with non-use associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer death: HR (95% CI) =0.69 (0.56-0.86). However, in the same time-frame, those using ASA less than daily had an increased risk of breast cancer death: HR (95% CI) =1.43 (1.09-1.87).S:  Contrary to other studies, we did not find that ASA use was associated with a lower risk of death from breast cancer, except when assessed short term with no delay to death/end of follow-up, which may reflect discontinuation of ASA during terminal illness.
 The naturally-occurring omega (ω)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces colorectal adenoma (polyp) number and size in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The safety profile and potential cardiovascular benefits associated with ω-3 PUFAs make EPA a strong candidate for colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention, alone or in combination with aspirin, which itself has recognized anti-CRC activity. Colorectal adenoma number and size are recognized as biomarkers of future CRC risk and are established as surrogate end-points in CRC chemoprevention trials.DESIGN: "DESIGN" The seAFOod Polyp Prevention Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial 'efficacy' study, which will determine whether EPA prevents colorectal adenomas, either alone or in combination with aspirin. Participants are 55-73 year-old patients, who have been identified as 'high risk' (detection of ≥5 small adenomas or ≥3 adenomas with at least one being ≥10 mm in diameter) at screening colonoscopy in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP). Exclusion criteria include the need for more than one repeat endoscopy within the three-month BCSP screening period, malignant change in an adenoma, regular use of aspirin or non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, regular use of fish oil supplements and concomitant warfarin or anti-platelet agent therapy. Patients are randomized to either EPA-free fatty acid 1 g twice daily or identical placebo AND aspirin 300 mg once daily or identical placebo, for approximately 12 months. The primary end-point is the number of participants with one or more adenomas detected at routine one-year BCSP surveillance colonoscopy. Secondary end-points include the number of adenomas (total and 'advanced') per patient, the location (left versus right colon) of colorectal adenomas and the number of participants re-classified as 'intermediate risk' for future surveillance. Exploratory end-points include levels of bioactive lipid mediators such as ω-3 PUFAs, resolvin E1 and PGE-M in plasma, urine, erythrocytes and rectal mucosa in order to gain insights into the mechanism(s) of action of EPA and aspirin, alone and in combination, as well as to discover predictive biomarkers of chemopreventive efficacy. The recruitment target is 904 patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN05926847.
 Gastroprotective agents are recommended for patients receiving low-dose aspirin (LDA) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker recently approved for the prevention of peptic ulcer recurrence in patients receiving LDA or NSAIDs.METHODS:  This phase 2, open-label, single-center study in healthy Japanese males evaluated drug-drug interactions between vonoprazan 40 mg and LDA (100 mg) or NSAIDs [loxoprofen sodium (60 mg), diclofenac sodium (25 mg), or meloxicam (10 mg)] and vice versa. Subjects were allocated to one of eight cohorts and received their orally administered treatment regimen (to assess the effect of vonoprazan vs. NSAID or LDA, or vice versa) once daily. Endpoints were the pharmacokinetics of plasma concentrations of the study drugs alone and in combination (primary), safety (secondary), and vonoprazan effects on aspirin-mediated inhibition of platelet-aggregation.RESULTS:  Of 109 subjects screened, 64 were assigned to one of eight cohorts (n = 8 per cohort) and received treatment, one subject discontinued due to a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 63 completed the study. There were few differences in the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan when administered with LDA or NSAIDs, and few differences in the pharmacokinetics of LDA or NSAIDs when administered with vonoprazan. The differences were small and not clinically meaningful. Inhibition of arachidonic-induced platelet aggregation by LDA was not influenced by vonoprazan. Six patients experienced a TEAE, all were mild and were deemed unrelated to study drugs. One subject withdrew due to infection (tonsillitis).S:  No clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions were observed and vonoprazan was well tolerated when administered with LDA or NSAIDs.STUDY REGISTRATION: "STUDY REGISTRATION" JapicCTI-153100.
 Aspirin therapy is associated with adverse upper gastrointestinal effects. PA32540 is a coordinated-delivery tablet containing enteric-coated aspirin (EC-ASA) 325 mg and immediate-release (IR) omeprazole 40 mg. Immediate-release omeprazole (located in outer layer of tablet) is available for instantaneous dissolution rapidly after ingestion, while dissolution of the EC-ASA core is delayed until pH >5.5.AIM: "AIM" To compare the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of PA32540 (EC-ASA 325 mg + IR-omeprazole 40 mg) vs. enteric-coated (EC)-omeprazole 40 mg.METHODS:  This single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in healthy volunteers compared 7 days of once-daily dosing with PA32540 with 7 days of once-daily EC-ASA 325 mg + EC-omeprazole 40 mg dosed concomitantly. The primary endpoint was per cent time intragastric pH >4 over 24 h on Day 7. A key secondary endpoint was determination of the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole and salicylic acid.RESULTS:  Twenty-six subjects (mean age 29 years) were enrolled into the study. On Day 7, mean per cent time intragastric pH >4 was 50.6% for PA32540 and 57.6% for EC-omeprazole 40 mg (P = 0.004) and geometric least squares mean AUC0-24 for omeprazole was 1446 h*ng/mL for PA32540 and 2558 h*ng/mL for EC-omeprazole 40 mg. Day 7 median Tmax of omeprazole was 0.5 h for PA32540 and 1.25 h for EC-omeprazole 40 mg.: "" Total exposure to omeprazole from PA32540 was 57% of that from EC-omeprazole for the same dose amount (40 mg), while absolute difference in 24-h acid control was 7%. Omeprazole exposure and pH control with PA32540 appear similar to EC-omeprazole 20 mg.
 Results from prospective studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may decrease lung cancer risk; however, any protective effect appears to be most evident in men.METHODS:  We evaluated the associations between NSAID use and lung cancer incidence in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) adjusting for female-specific potential confounders such as hormone therapy in addition to smoking histories and other potential confounders. We identified 143,841 women from ages 50 to 79 and 1,902 centrally confirmed lung cancer cases were included in the analysis. We used Cox regression models to estimate HRs and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).RESULTS:  Compared with nonuse, regular NSAID use was not associated with overall lung cancer incidence (NSAID use >10 years HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.08, P(trend) = 0.13). No statistically significant associations were found when examined by histologic subtypes and although there was a trend of decreased risk with longer duration of NSAID use in the adenocarcinoma subtype, this was not statistically significant (NSAID use >10 years HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58-1.10; P(trend) = 0.07).: "" Our study did not show that NSAID use is associated with lung cancer risk in women even after adjusting for female-specific confounders. There was a trend of decreased risk in the adenocarcinoma subtype; however, this was not statistically significant.IMPACT: "IMPACT" Future studies will need to take in account the various molecular subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer to further elucidate the role of NSAIDs in lung cancer, especially for the adenocarcinoma subtype.
Identification of outpatients with high platelet reactivity (HPR) on antiplatelet treatment is an unmet need. The present study was conducted in healthy individuals (n = 50) and in outpatients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at a distance from the acute ischemic episode (aspirin group, n = 71; aspirin/clopidogrel group, n = 106). We studied the feasibility and the precision of whole blood multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) after triggering platelet aggregation by arachidonic acid or adenosine diphospate (ADP). The MEA can be performed on whole blood within 2 hours after sample venipuncture. The threshold for the diagnosis of HPR is situated at 55 and 50 U for the arachidonic acid and ADP test, respectively. Frequency of HPR was 7% and 20% in aspirin and aspirin/clopidogrel groups, respectively. In 3.8% of patients in aspirin/clopidogrel group, combined HPR on aspirin and clopidogrel was found. In outpatients with CAD, use of MEA is feasible for the diagnosis of HPR.
 This paper describes the rationale and design of the ENVIS-ion Study, which aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin reduces the development of white matter hyper-intense (WMH) lesions and silent brain infarction (SBI). Additional aims include determining whether a) changes in retinal vascular imaging (RVI) parameters parallel changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); b) changes in RVI parameters are observed with aspirin therapy; c) baseline cognitive function correlates with MRI and RVI parameters; d) changes in cognitive function correlate with changes in brain MRI and RVI and e) whether factors such as age, gender or blood pressure influence the above associations.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of three years duration set in two Australian academic medical centre outpatient clinics. This study will enrol 600 adults aged 70 years and over with normal cognitive function and without overt cardiovascular disease. Subjects will undergo cognitive testing, brain MRI and RVI at baseline and after 3 years of study treatment. All subjects will be recruited from a 19,000-patient clinical outcome trial conducted in Australia and the United States that will evaluate the effects of aspirin in maintaining disability-free longevity over 5 years. The intervention will be aspirin 100 mg daily versus matching placebo, randomized on a 1:1 basis.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" This study will improve understanding of the mechanisms at the level of brain and vascular structure that underlie the effects of aspirin on cognitive function. Given the limited access and high cost of MRI, RVI may prove useful as a tool for the identification of individuals at high risk for the development of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.
"S" The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that aspirin would reduce the risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) in patients with pneumonia.BACKGROUNDS: "BACKGROUNDS" Pooled data suggest that pneumonia may trigger an ACS as a result of inflammatory reactions and the prothrombotic changes in patients with pneumonia. Hypothetically considering its antiaggregating and anti-inflammatory effects, aspirin might also be beneficial for the primary prevention of ACS in patients with pneumonia.METHODS:  One hundred and eighty-five patients with pneumonia who had more than one risk factor for cardiovascular disease were randomized to an aspirin group (n=91) or a control group (n=94). The patients in the aspirin group received 300 mg of aspirin daily for 1 month. ECGs were recorded on admission and 48 h and 30 days after admission to assess silent ischemia. The level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was measured on admission and 48 h after admission. The primary endpoint was the development of ACS within 1 month. The secondary endpoints included cardiovascular death and death from any cause within 1 month.RESULTS:  The χ-test showed that the rates of ACS at 1 month were 1.1% (n=1) in the aspirin group and 10.6% (n=10) in the control group (relative risk, 0.103; 95% confidence interval 0.005-0.746; P=0.015). Aspirin therapy was associated with a 9% absolute reduction in the risk for ACS. There was no significant decrease in the risk of death from any cause (P=0.151), but the aspirin group had a decreased risk of cardiovascular death (risk reduction: 0.04, P=0.044).: "" This randomized open-label study shows that acetyl salicylic acid is beneficial in the reduction of ACS and cardiovascular mortality among patients with pneumonia.
"S" The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of aspirin on lithium-related sexual dysfunction in men with stable bipolar affective disorder (BAD).METHODS:  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 men with stable BAD who had been on lithium maintenance therapy randomly received aspirin (240 mg/day) or placebo for six weeks. The International Index for Erectile Function (IIEF) was used to assess sexual symptoms at baseline, Week 3, and Week 6. Depressive and mania symptoms and plasma lithium concentrations were assessed at baseline and Week 6. Side effects were assessed using a checklist.RESULTS:  Thirty patients (15/group) completed the study. Baseline and endpoint lithium concentrations and mania and depressive symptoms did not differ significantly between the two groups. Significant effects of time × treatment interaction were observed for total score [Greenhouse-Geisser: F(1.410,39.466) = 6.084, p = 0.010] and erectile function [Greenhouse-Geisser: F(1.629,45.602) = 7.250, p = 0.003]. By Week 6, patients in the aspirin group showed significantly greater improvement in the total (63.9% improvement from the baseline) and erectile function domain (85.4% improvement from the baseline) scores than the placebo group (14.4% and 19.7% improvement from the baseline, p-values = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). By Week 6, 12 (80%) patients in the aspirin group and three (20%) patients in the placebo group met the criteria of minimal clinically important change [χ(2) (1) = 10.800, p = 0.001]. Other IIEF domains also showed significant improvement at the end of the trial. The frequency of side effects was similar between the two groups.: "" Aspirin effectively improves lithium-related sexual dysfunction in men with stable BAD.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Aspirin early after intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke increases the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), without influencing functional outcome at 3 months. The effect of aspirin on early neurological deterioration (END) was explored as a post hoc analysis of the randomized Antiplatelet Therapy in Combination With Recombinant t-PA Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke (ARTIS) trial.METHODS:  END, defined as a ≥4 points National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale worsening ≤24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, was categorized into SICH (ENDSICH) and cerebral ischemia (ENDCI). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the effect of aspirin on END.RESULTS:  Of the 640 patients, 31 patients (4.8%) experienced END (14 ENDSICH, 17 ENDCI). Aspirin increased the risk of ENDSICH (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-13.49) but not of ENDCI (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-3.00). After adjustment for other explanatory variables, the association between aspirin and ENDSICH remained significant.S:  In this trial, there is no evidence of an early antithrombotic effect from the addition of aspirin to intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke.
"S" Platelet-leukocyte aggregation is believed to contribute to acute thrombotic events. While the effect of aspirin on platelet-to-platelet aggregation is well established, the impact of the drug on pro-inflammatory platelet function remains equivocal. Thus we investigated the effect of aspirin on selected platelet-related inflammatory biomarkers in both acute ischaemic stroke patients and healthy volunteers.METHODS:  Using five-colour flow cytometry the platelet surface expression of CD62P and CD40L and subpopulations of leukocyte-platelet aggregates were assessed in 63 acute stroke patients and 40 healthy volunteers at baseline and after a 10-day period of aspirin intake at a daily dose of 150 mg. Simultaneously the plasma levels of soluble CD62P and CD40L, serum level of TxB(2), and whole blood impedance platelet aggregation under arachidonic acid (AA) stimulation were investigated.RESULTS:  No differences in values of studied platelet-related inflammatory biomarkers in both resting platelets and those activated with TRAP after 10-day treatment with aspirin were confirmed in stroke subjects. In healthy individuals the resting platelet expression of CD62P, plasma level of soluble CD62P and percentage of circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates were lower after the aspirin intake period (P=0.009; P=0.04; P=0.004, respectively). In both studied groups serum level of TxB(2) and platelet aggregation under AA stimulation were lower than before treatment (P<0.001).: "" Despite effective inhibition of COX-1-dependent platelet aggregation, aspirin does not influence the platelet α-granule-derived inflammatory mediators and monocyte-platelet aggregation in acute stroke subjects, although it does in healthy individuals.
Arterial stroke is the main cause of poor outcome in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Aspirin has an antithrombotic action at low dose and anti-ischemic and anti-inflammatory properties, which are dose-related. The aim of the study was to explore the possible benefits of aspirin in children with tuberculous meningitis. A total of 146 consecutive children with a diagnosis of probable tuberculous meningitis were studied. Patients were randomized into 3 groups: (1) placebo group, (2) low-dose aspirin group, and (3) high-dose aspirin group. Twenty-nine additional patients who received aspirin before admission were excluded from the randomized study, but continued on low-dose aspirin. Aspirin, irrespective of dose, did not show any significant benefit regarding morbidity (hemiparesis and developmental outcome) and mortality. Aspirin was well tolerated, but 1 death was probably related to aspirin. The fact that the outcome of the high-dose aspirin group compared favorably with the other treatment groups despite younger age and more severe neurological involvement at baseline needs further investigation.
Trehalose has several novel anti-inflammatory and cell-protective functions. We hypothesized that lyophilized aspirin/trehalose could decrease the severity of aspirin-induced gastropathy. Thirteen dogs were assigned into aspirin, lyophilized aspirin/trehalose, and control groups, and the gastric lesions were assessed on gastroscopy with the modified Lanza scale. Another 6 dogs were used to measure the plasma aspirin concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography after aspirin or lyophilized aspirin/trehalose administration. The results indicated that lyophilized aspirin/trehalose induced less gastric ulceration than aspirin despite maintaining therapeutic concentrations of plasma aspirin in both the groups. Lyophilized aspirin/trehalose might be a solution to decrease aspirin-induced gastropathy.
"" This study aimed to elucidate the association between the adverse gastric effects of enteric-coated aspirin and the timing of its administration.METHODS:  The study population comprised 572 patients (age range 45-84 years) admitted to Huaiyin Hospital between August 2012 and October 2014. Patients were administered a 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin tablet once daily: before a meal (30 min before a meal), during a meal, after a meal (30 min after a meal), or before sleep, and all patients were followed up for 6-9 months to observe for adverse gastric reactions and other side effects. Gastroscopy was performed if indicated by the patient's condition after obtaining due consent. In addition, release tests for an enteric-coated aspirin tablet were conducted using the chromatography method.RESULTS:  Enteric-coated aspirin tablets released completely, with a release rate of >99 % under 20-120 min at pH > 5.5. Furthermore, the number of patients with recurring adverse stomach reactions was significantly lower in the before-meal and before-sleep groups than that observed in the during-meal and after-meal groups (p < 0.05). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to damage to other organs. Similarly, the number of patients with gastric lesions was significantly lower in the before-meal and before-sleep groups than that observed in the during-meal and after-meal groups (p < 0.05).S:  The optimal time for once-daily administration of low-dose enteric-coated aspirin tablets was before a meal or before sleep owing to the increase in pH level during and after meals.
"IMPORTANCE" Prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases is an important public health priority in Japan due to an aging population.: "" To determine whether daily, low-dose aspirin reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in older Japanese patients with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: "DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS" The Japanese Primary Prevention Project (JPPP) was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients (N = 14,464) were aged 60 to 85 years, presenting with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus recruited by primary care physicians at 1007 clinics in Japan between March 2005 and June 2007, and were followed up for up to 6.5 years, with last follow-up in May 2012. A multidisciplinary expert panel (blinded to treatment assignments) adjudicated study outcomes.INTERVENTIONS: "INTERVENTIONS" Patients were randomized 1:1 to enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg/d or no aspirin in addition to ongoing medications.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES" Composite primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular causes), nonfatal stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic, including undefined cerebrovascular events), and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes included individual end points.RESULTS:  The study was terminated early by the data monitoring committee after a median follow-up of 5.02 years (interquartile range, 4.55-5.33) based on likely futility. In both the aspirin and no aspirin groups, 56 fatal events occurred. Patients with an occurrence of nonfatal stroke totaled 114 in the aspirin group and 108 in the no aspirin group; of nonfatal myocardial infarction, 20 in the aspirin group and 38 in the no aspirin group; of undefined cerebrovascular events, 3 in the aspirin group and 5 in the no aspirin group. The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate was not significantly different between the groups (2.77% [95% CI, 2.40%-3.20%] for aspirin vs 2.96% [95% CI, 2.58%-3.40%] for no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]; P = .54). Aspirin significantly reduced incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (0.30 [95% CI, 0.19-0.47] for aspirin vs 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42-0.81] for no aspirin; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31-0.91]; P = .02) and transient ischemic attack (0.26 [95% CI, 0.16-0.42] for aspirin vs 0.49 [95% CI, 0.35-0.69] for no aspirin; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.32-0.99]; P = .04), and significantly increased the risk of extracranial hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization (0.86 [95% CI, 0.67-1.11] for aspirin vs 0.51 [95% CI, 0.37-0.72] for no aspirin; HR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.22-2.81]; P = .004).S AND RELEVANCE: "S AND RELEVANCE" Once-daily, low-dose aspirin did not significantly reduce the risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction among Japanese patients 60 years or older with atherosclerotic risk factors.
 The aim of this study was to analyze the benefits and safety associated with the combination therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin among minor stroke or transient ischemic attack patients treated within 12 hours.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" This was a subanalysis of the CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) trial, mainly limited to the prespecified group of patients randomized within 12 hours to either the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke during 90-day follow-up. Recurrent ischemic stroke and progressive ischemic stroke were analyzed. Multivariable Cox modeling showed that randomization within 12 hours was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.25 [1.04-1.49], P=0.02). Among 2573 patients randomized within 12 hours, 282 (10.96%) patients had ischemic stroke events. Among them, 158 (12.34%) of 1280 patients taking aspirin experienced ischemic stroke compared with 124 (9.59%) of 1293 patients taking clopidogrel-aspirin (P=0.02). The dual antiplatelet was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (6.57% versus 8.91%, P=0.03) but not progressive ischemic stroke (3.02% versus 3.43%, P=0.28). There was no significant difference in hemorrhagic events (P=0.39).S:  Among patients treated within 12 hours, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke during the 90-day follow-up and did not increase the hemorrhagic risk.
 The role of aspirin in thromboprophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is controversial.: "" To compare extended prophylaxis with aspirin and dalteparin for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) after THA.DESIGN: "DESIGN" Multicenter randomized, controlled trial with a noninferiority design based on a minimal clinically important difference of 2.0%. Randomization was electronically generated; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program. Patients, physicians, study coordinators, health care team members, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts were blinded to interventions. (Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN11902170).SETTING: "SETTING" 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada.PATIENTS: "PATIENTS" 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010.INTERVENTION: "INTERVENTION" After an initial 10 days of dalteparin prophylaxis after elective THA, patients were randomly assigned to 28 days of dalteparin (n = 400) or aspirin (n = 386).MEASUREMENTS: "MEASUREMENTS" Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing (primary efficacy outcome) and bleeding.RESULTS:  Five of 398 patients (1.3%) randomly assigned to dalteparin and 1 of 380 (0.3%) randomly assigned to aspirin had VTE (absolute difference, 1.0 percentage point [95% CI, -0.5 to 2.5 percentage points]). Aspirin was noninferior (P < 0.001) but not superior (P = 0.22) to dalteparin. Clinically significant bleeding occurred in 5 patients (1.3%) receiving dalteparin and 2 (0.5%) receiving aspirin. The absolute between-group difference in a composite of all VTE and clinically significant bleeding events was 1.7 percentage points (CI, -0.3 to 3.8 percentage points; P = 0.091) in favor of aspirin.LIMITATION: "LIMITATION" The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment.: "" Extended prophylaxis for 28 days with aspirin was noninferior to and as safe as dalteparin for the prevention of VTE after THA in patients who initially received dalteparin for 10 days. Given its low cost and greater convenience, aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: "PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE" Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
"BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS" Low doses of aspirin can injure the gastric mucosa. It is not clear whether other drugs such as the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel also cause gastric mucosal injury or exacerbate aspirin-induced injury, or whether proton pump inhibitors prevent damage.METHODS:  Twenty Japanese subjects with different CYP2C19 genotypes were randomly assigned to groups that were given a low dose of aspirin (100 mg; A), clopidogrel (75 mg; C), low dose of aspirin and clopidogrel (AC), or low dose of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel and rabeprazole (10 mg; ACR) once daily for 7 days. Subjects underwent gastroduodenoscopy and platelet tests on days 3 and 7; gastric mucosal damage was assessed by using the modified Lanza score (MLS). We performed 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on day 7 of each regimen. We also analyzed the effects of the AC regimen on 30 patients with different CYP2C19 genotypes.RESULTS:  Subjects in groups A, C, and AC had significantly higher levels of gastric mucosal damage on days 3 and 7, compared with baseline. The median MLS for the AC group was similar to that of the A group. Helicobacter pylori-negative subjects in the ACR group with different CYP2C19 genotypes had significant differences in MLS, intragastric pH, and platelet function. Gastric mucosal injury was inhibited equally among H pylori-positive subjects in the ACR group. Rabeprazole did not appear to affect platelet function or intragastric pH in subjects given clopidogrel.S:  Clopidogrel and low doses of aspirin cause a similar degree of gastric mucosal damage. Rabeprazole prevented this damage without reducing the antiplatelet function of clopidogrel. However, its prophylactic effect varies with CYP2C19 genotype in H pylori-negative subjects.
"BACKGROUND AND S" The aim of this study was, first, to investigate the effect of omega 3 (ω3) fatty acids plus low-dose aspirin with closed debridement in the treatment of patients with periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and second, to estimate the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) in response to the supposed modulatory therapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: "MATERIAL AND METHODS" Forty patients with chronic periodontitis and type 2 DM were equally divided into groups 1 (patients received ω3 plus low-dose aspirin for 6 mo) and 2 (patients received placebo during the same period). Evaluation was done clinically (pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival index and plaque index) and biochemically by estimating levels of interleukin 1β and MCP-3 in gingival crevicular fluid, plus investigating the effect of treatment on glycemic control by levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c in serum. All data were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 mo after treatment.RESULTS:  Subjects of group 1 showed a highly significant reduction in pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival index (p ≤ 0.01) after 3 and 6 mo compared to group 2. Glycated hemoglobin A1c levels showed a reduction in both groups at the end of the study period, with a non-significant difference (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the treatment protocol showed a significant reduction in levels of MCP-3 and interleukin 1β at 3 and 6 mo compared to the placebo group.S:  Within the limits of the present study, ω3 plus low-dose aspirin proved effective as an adjunct to closed periodontal therapy in the management of patients with periodontitis and type 2 DM. Moreover, MCP-3 was proven to be effective both in the pathogenesis of the disease and as a biomarker in evaluating the response to periodontal treatment.
We sought to assess the performance of existing bleeding risk scores, such as the Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol Concomitantly (HAS-BLED) score or the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index (OBRI), in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in sinus rhythm (SR) treated with warfarin or aspirin. We calculated HAS-BLED and OBRI risk scores for 2,305 patients with HFrEF in SR enrolled in the Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction trial. Proportional hazards models were used to test whether each score predicted major bleeding, and comparison of different risk scores was performed using Harell C-statistic and net reclassification improvement index. For the warfarin arm, both scores predicted bleeding risk, with OBRI having significantly greater C-statistic (0.72 vs 0.61; p = 0.03) compared to HAS-BLED, although the net reclassification improvement for comparing OBRI to HAS-BLED was not significant (0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.18 to 0.37). Performance of the OBRI and HAS-BLED risk scores was similar for the aspirin arm. For participants with OBRI scores of 0 to 1, warfarin compared with aspirin reduced ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.98, p = 0.042) without significantly increasing major bleeding (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.30, p = 0.51). For those with OBRI score of ≥2, there was a trend for reduced ischemic stroke with warfarin compared to aspirin (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.15, p = 0.12), but major bleeding was increased (HR 4.04, 95% CI 1.99 to 8.22, p <0.001). In conclusion, existing bleeding risk scores can identify bleeding risk in patients with HFrEF in SR and could be tested for potentially identifying patients with a favorable risk/benefit profile for antithrombotic therapy with warfarin. 
 Venous leg ulceration is a common and costly problem that is expected to worsen as the population ages. Current treatment is compression therapy; however, up to 50 % of ulcers remain unhealed after 2 years, and ulcer recurrence is common. New treatments are needed to address those wounds that are more challenging to heal. Targeting the inflammatory processes present in venous ulcers is a possible strategy. Limited evidence suggests that a daily dose of aspirin may be an effective adjunct to aid ulcer healing and reduce recurrence. The Aspirin in Venous Leg Ulcer study (ASPiVLU) will investigate whether 300-mg oral doses of aspirin improve time to healing.METHODS/DESIGN: "METHODS/DESIGN" This randomised, double-blinded, multicentre, placebo-controlled, clinical trial will recruit participants with venous leg ulcers from community settings and hospital outpatient wound clinics across Australia. Two hundred sixty-eight participants with venous leg ulcers will be randomised to receive either aspirin or placebo, in addition to compression therapy, for 24 weeks. The primary outcome is time to healing within 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are ulcer recurrence, wound pain, quality of life and wellbeing, adherence to study medication, adherence to compression therapy, serum inflammatory markers, hospitalisations, and adverse events at 24 weeks.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" The ASPiVLU trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunct to compression therapy to treat venous leg ulcers. Study completion is anticipated to occur in December 2018.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12614000293662.
 If percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is required in patients taking oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is indicated, but such triple therapy increases the risk of serious bleeding. We investigated the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel alone compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin.METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial in 15 centres in Belgium and the Netherlands. From November, 2008, to November, 2011, adults receiving oral anticoagulants and undergoing PCI were assigned clopidogrel alone (double therapy) or clopidogrel plus aspirin (triple therapy). The primary outcome was any bleeding episode within 1 year of PCI, assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00769938" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00769938</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" 573 patients were enrolled and 1-year data were available for 279 (98·2%) patients assigned double therapy and 284 (98·3%) assigned triple therapy. Mean ages were 70·3 (SD 7·0) years and 69·5 (8·0) years, respectively. Bleeding episodes were seen in 54 (19·4%) patients receiving double therapy and in 126 (44·4%) receiving triple therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·36, 95% CI 0·26-0·50, p<0·0001). In the double-therapy group, six (2·2%) patients had multiple bleeding events, compared with 34 (12·0%) in the triple-therapy group. 11 (3·9%) patients receiving double therapy required at least one blood transfusion, compared with 27 (9·5%) patients in the triple-therapy group (odds ratio from Kaplan-Meier curve 0·39, 95% CI 0·17-0·84, p=0·011).INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" Use of clopiogrel without aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in bleeding complications and no increase in the rate of thrombotic events.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Antonius Ziekenhuis Foundation, Strect Foundation.
G protein-coupled receptor signaling plays a crucial role in platelet function. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs), which accelerate the deactivation of G protein signaling, are expressed in platelets. However, RGS expression has not been studied in the context of aspirin resistance. We compared RGS mRNA levels in platelets from 39 aspirin-resistant patients and 50 aspirin-sensitive patients with metabolic syndrome. Although there were no clinical differences between the two groups, transcripts of RGS2, RGS10, and RGS18 were significantly higher in aspirin-resistant patients than in aspirin-sensitive patients. This study is the first to demonstrate that RGS transcripts are elevated in aspirin-resistant platelets from patients with metabolic syndrome.
"S" Controversy has been prompted based on drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and aspirin/clopidogrel leading to weakened effects. However, whether such interaction was drug-specific or class effect remains controversial. This study predicted the impact of esomeprazole and rabeprazole on efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).METHODS:  This study, involving 150 patients, evaluated the efficacy of DAPT upon concomitant use of esomeprazole (40 mg/d) or rabeprazole (20 mg/d). Platelet reactivity was assessed by value of ADP-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) at day 1, day 3 and day 30 end points after initiation of DAPT.RESULTS:  No significance were observed by post-hoc analysis of treatment-by-period interaction in LTA value and VASP-PRI value when compared with non-PPI users, which suggests no carryover effect in both PPIs over the 30-day treatment period. Moreover, no statistical differences was in LTA or VASP-PRI value in esomeprazole group while rabeprazole group showed decreased in antiplatelet function of DAPT at the day 3 and day 30 end points.: "" Although antiplatelet effect of DAPT were not affected upon concomitant use of both PPIs over the 30-day treatment period, esomeprazole exerts much more stable impact on antiplatelet effect than rabeprazole among respective end points.
"STUDY QUESTION" What is the association between daily preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin (LDA) treatment and very early pregnancy losses or euploid (chromosomally normal) losses among women with one to two prior losses?SUMMARY ANSWER: "SUMMARY ANSWER" Daily LDA initiated preconception was not associated with the rate or type of pregnancy loss among women with a history of one to two prior pregnancy losses.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: "WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY" LDA is often used to treat recurrent pregnancy loss with reductions in pregnancy loss generally only observed among women with antiphospholipid antibodies, and null associations observed among women without antiphospholipid antibodies. We previously evaluated the association between LDA and pregnancy loss overall among women with one to two prior losses in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial and found no association, though did not distinguish between potential effects at different stages of pregnancy loss, including implantation failure, or between euploid and aneuploid losses.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: "STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION" The EAGeR trial was a multi-site prospective block-randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1228 women were randomized to daily LDA (81 mg/day) plus folic acid (400 mcg/day), or placebo plus folic acid. Participants were assigned study drug for less than or equal to six menstrual cycles or if they conceived, throughout pregnancy with study drug discontinued at 36 weeks gestation. This analysis includes additional outcome information obtained from chart abstractions after the completion of the trial, as well as testing of stored urine for measurement of hCG and detection of very early pregnancy losses, and karyotyping of the products of conception for assessment of aneuploidy of the losses.PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS: "PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS" Women aged 18-40 with a history of one to two prior losses and actively trying to conceive were randomized (n = 615 LDA and n = 613 placebo) at four clinical centers in the USA (2007-2011). Log-binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios under the intent-to-treat approach.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: "MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE" Daily LDA initiated preconception was not associated with clinically recognized pregnancy losses or implantation failures among women with proved fecundity and a history of one to two prior losses. Specifically, 1088 (88.6%) women completed the trial with 797 having an hCG detected pregnancy (64.9%). Overall there were 133 clinical losses (12.7% LDA versus 11.8% placebo, P = 0.71) and 55 implantation failures (5.2% LDA versus 4.9% placebo, P = 0.89). No differences were found in rate of euploid losses (RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.26).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: "LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION" Generalizability of these findings is limited to women with a history of one to two prior losses, and may further be limited to women of white race with higher socioeconomic status as given the rigors of the study protocol participants tended to be white and have higher incomes and more education. We were also missing karyotype information on approximately one-third of the clinically recognized pregnancy losses, which may limit our power to detect effects on euploid losses, though detailed sensitivity analysis showed similar results.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: "WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS" Our data do not support the general use of LDA to decrease pregnancy loss and further demonstrate no increased risk of loss for women on LDA treatment.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: "STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS" This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (Contract Nos.

"BACKGROUND AND S" A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate may improve medication adherence. However, the absence of data on the relative antiplatelet efficacy of FDC and separate dual pills (SDP) of aspirin and clopidogrel in real-world patients with stable coronary artery disease is a major factor retarding clinical introduction of such an FDC.METHODS:  This was a single-centre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial. Patients who maintained a regimen of separate aspirin and clopidogrel pills for at least 1 year after drug-eluting stent implantation without adverse events were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to either the FDC group or the SDP group. Antiplatelet efficacy and tolerability were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks.RESULTS:  Of the 93 enrolled patients, 83 (FDC group: n = 42; SDP group: n = 41) completed the study. The difference in the changes in P2Y12 percentage inhibition did not exceed the predetermined value for inferiority [mean difference -1.7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) -6.9 to 4.5, p < 0.001 for non-inferiority]. The changes from baseline to 4 weeks in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) (mean difference 9.7 PRU, p = 0.46), maximal platelet aggregation (mean difference 2.0 %, p = 0.44) and aspirin reaction units (ARU) (mean difference -2.3 ARU, p = 0.88) did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. The tolerability of the FDC formulation was similar to that of SDP therapy (p = 0.68).: "" In patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention, the antiplatelet efficacy of the aspirin/clopidogrel FDC was non-inferior to that of SDP and the tolerability of the two regimens was similar after 4 weeks of treatment.
 Beta-blockers (BB) and statins (S) independently have been shown to reduce perioperative mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing vascular surgery. In this study we evaluated the benefits of adding aspirin (A) to BB and S (ABBS), with/without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on postoperative outcome in high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.METHODS:  Analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery at the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done using cardiac risk index [Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), cerebral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and major surgery]; pulmonary disease; and A, BB, S (ABBS)±ACE-I use. Baseline clinical characteristics and medication were adjusted using propensity scores. Endpoints were bleeding, 30-day MI, stroke, and 12-month mortality.RESULTS:  Between 2003 and 2010, 4,149 arterial procedures were performed, 819 of which were risk stratified as RCRI≥3. The incidence of MI was 3-fold lower (2.5% vs. 7.8%, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.61, P=0.001) in ABBS±ACE-I (n=513) as compared with non-ABBS±ACE-I (n=306). The 12-month mortality was 8-fold lower in ABBS±ACE-I as compared non-ABBS±ACE-I (5.9% vs. 37.5%, HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08-0.20, P<0.0001). After adjustment for the propensity to use various therapies, A (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24-0.53, P<0.0001), BB (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-1.0, P=0.05), and S (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, P<0.0001) remained associated with improved 12-month survival. ACE-I use (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.19, P=0.27) was not predictive. Aspirin did not predict severe/moderate bleeding.S:  In high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery, ABBS therapy has superior 30-day and 12-month risk reduction benefits for MI, stroke, and mortality as compared with A, BB, or S independently. ACE-I did not demonstrate additional risk-reduction benefits.
Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterized by enhanced platelet generation and thrombotic complications. Once-daily low-dose aspirin incompletely inhibits platelet thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) in the majority of ET patients. In the present study, we investigated the determinants of aspirin-insensitive platelet TXA(2) biosynthesis and whether it could be further suppressed by changing the aspirin dose, formulation, or dosing interval. In 41 aspirin-treated ET patients, the immature platelet count predicted serum TXB(2) independently of platelet count, age, JAK-2 V617F mutation, or cytoreduction (β = 3.53, P = .001). Twenty-one aspirin-treated patients with serum TXB(2) ≥ 4 ng/mL at 24 hours after dosing were randomized to the following 7-day regimens in a crossover design: enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg twice daily, enteric-coated aspirin 200 mg once daily, or plain aspirin 100 mg once daily. A twice-daily regimen caused a further 88% median (IQR, 78%-92%, P < .001) TXB(2) reduction and normalized the functional platelet response to aspirin, as assessed by urinary 11-dehydro-TXB(2) excretion and the VerifyNow Aspirin assay. Doubling the aspirin dose reduced serum TXB(2) only partially by 39% median (IQR, 29%-54%, P < .05). We conclude that the abnormal megakaryopoiesis characterizing ET accounts for a shorter-lasting antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin through faster renewal of platelet cyclooxygenase-1, and impaired platelet inhibition can be rescued by modulating the aspirin dosing interval rather than the dose.
"INTRODUCTION" This study was conducted to evaluate preventive effect of a combination of heparin and aspirin on vascular thrombosis and kidney transplant outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients.: "" Twenty-four pediatric kidney transplant recipients received heparin, 50 U/kg, every 8 hours for 7 postoperative days, and aspirin, 5 mg/kg, thrice a week from day 3 of transplantation for 3 months. These patients were compared with a matched group of pediatric kidney allograft recipients in terms of development of thrombosis and serum creatinine level at 1 year postoperation.RESULTS:  The mean age of patients was 9.4 ± 3.2 years. No vascular thrombosis was developed among the 24 patients with anticoagulant therapy, while in the control group, 5 grafts (7.9%) developed thrombosis (P = .19). Serum creatinine levels at 1 year were lower in the children with anticoagulant therapy as compared with the controls (P = .02).S:  Our study revealed a reduction in kidney allograft thrombosis incidence in children who received heparin and aspirin after transplantation, which was clinically important although the difference was not statistically significant. Lower serum creatinine levels as compared with a historical cohort group were seen 1 year after transplant surgery. These findings are required to be confirmed by further studies.
 The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and may be affected by the ability to resolve inflammation, which is an active process that involves specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) derived from n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids.: "" We compared plasma concentrations of SPMs in men and women with features of the MetS and in healthy matched control subjects in response to intakes of n-3 fatty acids and aspirin.DESIGN: "DESIGN" MetS volunteers (n = 22) and healthy, matched controls (n = 21) were studied in parallel for 4 wk. Both groups took n-3 fatty acids (2.4 g/d) for 4 wk with the addition of aspirin (300 mg/d) during the last 7 d. Blood was collected at baseline and at 3 and 4 wk. Plasma SPMs were measured with the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and included 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE), E-series resolvins, 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA), D-series resolvins, 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA), and maresin-1.RESULTS:  Baseline SPMs did not differ between groups. There was an increase in the SPM precursors 18-HEPE, 17-HDHA, and 14-HDHA after n-3 fatty acid supplementation that was significantly attenuated in the MetS (P < 0.05). However, the E-series resolvins increased to a similar extent in the groups after n-3 fatty acid supplementation, and the D-series resolvins were not different from those at baseline. The addition of aspirin to n-3 fatty acids did not alter any SPMs in either group.S:  Volunteers with MetS had reduced plasma concentrations of the precursors of the E- and D- series resolvins as well as of 14-HDHA in response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation. However, plasma E-series resolvins were increased to a similar extent after n-3 fatty acid supplementation in both groups, and the addition of aspirin to n-3 fatty acid supplementation did not alter any of the plasma SPMs in MetS and control subjects. Additional studies in the MetS are required to determine whether SPMs affect the ability to mount an appropriate response to infection. This trial was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12610000708055.
 In the AVERROES study, apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation who were at high risk of stroke but unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. We aimed to investigate whether the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) would show a greater benefit from apixaban compared with aspirin than would patients without previous cerebrovascular events.METHODS: In AVERROES, 5599 patients (mean age 70 years) with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk of stroke and unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy were randomly assigned to receive apixaban (5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81-324 mg per day). The mean follow-up was 1·1 years. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. In this prespecified subgroup analysis, we used Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-year event risk and Cox proportional hazards regression models to compare the effects of apixaban in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. AVERROES is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00496769" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00496769</a.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" In patients with previous stroke or TIA, ten events of stroke or systemic embolism occurred in the apixaban group (n=390, cumulative hazard 2·39% per year) compared with 33 in the aspirin group (n=374, 9·16% per year; hazard ratio [HR] 0·29, 95% CI 0·15-0·60). In those without previous stroke or TIA, 41 events occurred in the apixaban group (n=2417, 1·68% per year) compared with 80 in the aspirin group (n=2415, 3·06% per year; HR 0·51, 95% CI 0·35-0·74). The p value for interaction of the effects of aspirin and apixaban with previous cerebrovascular events was 0·17. Major bleeding was more frequent in patients with history of stroke or TIA than in patients without (HR 2·88, 95% CI 1·77-4·55) but risk of this event did not differ between treatment groups.INTERPRETATION: "INTERPRETATION" In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban is similarly effective whether or not patients have had a previous stroke or TIA. Given that those with previous stroke or TIA have a higher risk of stroke, the absolute benefits might be greater in these patients.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.
"S" The goal of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between aspirin dose and the potent antiplatelet agent prasugrel in the TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) study.BACKGROUND:  Optimal aspirin dosing after acute coronary syndromes remains uncertain. Previous studies have raised questions regarding an interaction between high-dose aspirin and the potent antiplatelet agent ticagrelor.METHODS:  In TRITON-TIMI 38, we classified 12,674 patients into low-dose (<150 mg) or high-dose (≥150 mg) aspirin groups based on discharge dose. We identified independent correlates of dose selection and studied the impact of aspirin dose on the clinical effects of prasugrel.RESULTS:  There was significant geographical variation in aspirin dosing, with North American patients receiving high-dose aspirin more frequently than other countries (66% vs. 28%; p < 0.001). Clinical factors correlating with high-dose aspirin included previous percutaneous coronary intervention and use of aspirin before randomization. Characteristics associated with the use of low-dose aspirin included age ≥75 years, white race, and use of bivalirudin or a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor during coronary intervention. Regardless of low- or high-dose aspirin use, prasugrel had lower rates of the primary efficacy endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke [CVD/MI/stroke]) (hazard ratio [HR]CVD/MI/stroke = 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.95] and HRCVD/MI/stroke = 0.87 [95% CI 0.69 to 1.10], respectively; p value for interaction = 0.48) and higher rates of the primary safety endpoint (HR TIMI major bleeding = 1.40 [95% CI 0.81 to 2.42] and TIMImajor bleeding = 1.30 [95% CI 0.63 to 2.68], respectively; p value for interaction = 0.84) compared with clopidogrel.
 Patients receiving anti-platelet agents for secondary cardiovascular prevention frequently require non-cardiac surgery. A substantial proportion of these patients have their anti-platelet drug discontinued before operation; however, there is uncertainty about the impact of this practice. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of maintenance or interruption of aspirin before surgery, in terms of major thrombotic and bleeding events.METHODS:  Patients treated with anti-platelet agents for secondary prevention and undergoing intermediate- or high-risk non-cardiac surgery were included in this multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial. We substituted non-aspirin anti-platelets with aspirin (75 mg daily) or placebo starting 10 days before surgery. The primary outcome was a composite score evaluating both major thrombotic and bleeding adverse events occurring within the first 30 postoperative days weighted by their severity (weights were established a priori using a Delphi consensus process). Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.RESULTS:  We randomized 291 patients (n=145, aspirin group, and n=146, placebo group). The most frequent surgical procedures were orthopaedic surgery (52.2%), abdominal surgery (20.6%), and urologic surgery (15.5%). No significant difference was observed neither in the primary outcome score [mean values (SD)=0.67 (2.05) in the aspirin group vs 0.65 (2.04) in the placebo group, P=0.94] nor at day 30 in the number of major complications between groups.S:  In these at-risk patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery, we did not find any difference in terms of occurrence of major thrombotic or bleeding events between preoperative maintenance or interruption of aspirin.
There is growing interest in understanding the effects of adding an oral anticoagulant in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and clopidogrel represent the most broadly utilised oral anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, respectively. However, VKAs can interfere with clopidogrel metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system which in turn may result in an increase in platelet reactivity. Dabigatran is a direct acting (anti-II) oral anticoagulant which does not interfere with CYP and has favourable safety and efficacy profiles compared with VKAs. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on platelet reactivity and clot kinetic of adjunctive dabigatran therapy in patients on DAPT are poorly explored. In this prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled PD study, patients (n=30) on maintenance DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel were randomised to either dabigatran 150 mg bid or placebo for seven days. PD testing was performed before and after treatment using four different assays exploring multiple pathways of platelet aggregation and fibrin clot kinetics: light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA), kaolin-activated thromboelastography (TEG) and turbidimetric assays. There were no differences in multiple measures of platelet reactivity investigating purinergic and non-purinergic signaling pathways assessed by LTA, MEA and TEG platelet mapping. Dabigatran significantly increased parameters related to thrombin activity and thrombus generation, and delayed fibrin clot formation, without affecting clot structure or fibrinolysis. In conclusion, in patients on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, adjunctive dabigatran therapy is not associated with modulation of profiles of platelet reactivity as determined by several assays assessing multiple platelet signalling pathways. However, dabigatran significantly interferes with parameters related to thrombin activity and delays fibrin clot formation. 
"" Low-dose aspirin reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. Recently, the aspirin effect has been shown to occur primarily in the proximal colon. Colonoscopy has been either less effective or ineffective in the proximal compared to the distal colon. The authors assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding low-dose aspirin to a simulated screening with colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.DESIGN: "DESIGN" A Markov model comparing the strategies of 10-year colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy screening and the combination of either of the two with low-dose aspirin in 100,000 subjects aged 50 years until death was constructed. Proximal and distal CRC prevention rates with endoscopy or aspirin were extracted from the literature. Screening and aspirin prevention were simulated to stop at 80 years. The cost of aspirin and aspirin-related complications, as well as aspirin-related mortality, was included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the different strategies were calculated. Sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were also performed.RESULTS:  The addition of low-dose aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy screening increased the CRC death prevention rate from 68% and 39% to 81% and 69%, respectively. Lifetime aspirin-related mortality appeared to be 0.1%. Because of the substantial reduction in CRC care, the addition of aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy screening was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US$5413 per life-year saved) and cost saving (US$278 per person), respectively. When the proximal CRC prevention rate with colonoscopy was increased 56% to 73% from the baseline, the addition of aspirin was no longer cost-effective. The addition of aspirin to colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy was a cost-effective strategy in 52% and 94% of the scenarios at probabilistic analysis.S:  When assuming a suboptimal efficacy of endoscopy in preventing CRC, the addition of low-dose aspirin may be an effective and cost-effective strategy, mainly because of its high efficacy in preventing proximal CRC.
"AIMS" Reduced aspirin efficacy has been demonstrated in people with Type 2 diabetes. Because increased platelet reactivity and/or turnover are postulated mechanisms, we examined whether higher and/or more frequent aspirin dosing might reduce platelet reactivity more effectively.METHODS:  Participants with Type 2 diabetes (n = 24) but without known cardiovascular disease were randomized in a three-way crossover design to 2-week treatment periods with aspirin 100 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily. The primary outcome was platelet reactivity, assessed using the VerifyNow(™) ASA method. Relationships between platelet reactivity and aspirin dosing were examined using generalized linear mixed models with random subject effects.RESULTS:  Platelet reactivity decreased from baseline with all doses of aspirin. Modelled platelet reactivity was more effectively reduced with aspirin 100 mg twice daily vs. 100 mg once daily, but not vs. 200 mg once daily. Aspirin 200 mg once daily did not differ from 100 mg once daily. Aspirin 100 mg twice daily was also more effective than once daily as measured by collagen/epinephrine-stimulated platelet aggregation and urinary thromboxane levels, with a similar trend measured by serum thromboxane levels. No episodes of bleeding occurred.S:  In Type 2 diabetes, aspirin 100 mg twice daily reduced platelet reactivity more effectively than 100 mg once daily, and numerically more than 200 mg once daily. Clinical outcome trials evaluating primary cardiovascular disease prevention with aspirin in Type 2 diabetes may need to consider using a more frequent dosing schedule.
Sudden cardiovascular events account for approximately 45% to 50% of all duty-related deaths among firefighters and a disproportionate number of these fatalities occur after strenuous fire suppression activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute and chronic aspirin supplementation on hemostatic function before and after live firefighting activities in older firefighters. A double-blind, crossover design included 4 treatments: a 2-week aspirin/placebo treatment ("chronic") and a single prefirefighting aspirin/placebo treatment ("acute"). Hemostatic function was assessed in 24 male firefighters (mean age = 48.2 ± 5.9 years) immediately before and after 18 minutes of live-fire firefighting activity. An acute bout of firefighting activity significantly decreased platelet aggregation time and decreased activated partial thromboplastin time. Compared with placebo, acute aspirin supplementation resulted in a significant increase in epinephrine closure time, which was further augmented by chronic supplementation. Aspirin supplementation had no effect on coagulatory or fibrinolytic factors. Our findings suggest that an acute bout of firefighting leads to increased coagulatory potential in older firefighters. In conclusion, aspirin supplementation had an antiplatelet effect that decreased platelet aggregability at rest and after an acute bout of firefighting compared with placebo. 
 High residual platelet reactivity in patients receiving clopidogrel is associated with an increased risk of a cardiovascular event after coronary stenting. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms on platelet reactivity during dual antiplatelet therapy.METHODS:  We determined the CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 genotypes of 101 angina patients (65 male patients, mean age 64 years) receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and evaluated the effect of these polymorphism on platelet reactivity at the early and late phases of treatment using a conventional light transmission aggregometry. Early and late phases were defined as 24 h after the loading dose and after 9 months on a maintenance dose of 75 mg daily, respectively.RESULTS:  The distribution of the CYP2C19 genotype was 30 % in extensive metabolizers (EM; CYP2C19*1/*1), 46 % in intermediate metabolizers (IM; *1/*2, *1/*3), and 25 % in poor metabolizers (PM; *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3). Platelet reactivity levels in during the early and late phases were 3,793 ± 1,476 and 2,960 ± 1,410, respectively, in EM, 4,706 ± 1,417 and 3,239 ± 1,479, respectively, in IM, and 5,402 ± 776 and 4,736 ± 1,356 aggregation units (AU)•min, respectively in EM. The distribution of the CYP3A5 genotype was 33 % in patients carrying the wild-type or one loss-of-function allele (Expressor phenotype; *1/*1 and *1/*3, respectively) and 67 % in those carrying two loss-of-function alleles (Non-expressor; *3/*3). In total, eight patients were EM+Expressor, 22 were EM+Non-expressor, 18 were IM+Expressor, 28 were IM+Non-expressor, eight were PM+Expressor, and 17 were PM+Non-expressor. In the late phase of PM with the CYP2C19 polymorphism, the levels of platelet reactivity according to CYP3A5 genotype were 3,963 ± 1,436 and 5,100 ± 1,190 AU•min in Expressor and Non-expressor, respectively (P < 0.05), however, there was no difference in platelet reactivity between Expressor and Non-expressor in EM and IM.S:  Our results suggest that antiplatelet response to clopidogrel in the late phase depends on the CYP3A5 polymorphism in PM with CYP2C19.
Coronary artery bypass grafting is pivotal in the contemporary management of complex coronary artery disease. Interpatient variability to antiplatelet agents, however, harbors the potential to compromise the revascularization benefit by increasing the incidence of adverse events. This study was designed to define the impact of dual antiplatelet therapy (dAPT) on clinical outcomes among aspirin-resistant patients who underwent coronary artery surgery. We randomly assigned 219 aspirin-resistant patients according to multiple electrode aggregometry to receive clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (300 mg) or aspirin-monotherapy (300 mg). The primary end point was a composite outcome of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization assessed at 6 months postoperatively. The primary end point occurred in 6% of patients assigned to dAPT and 10% of patients randomized to aspirin-monotherapy (relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.51, p = 0.33). No significant treatment effect was noted in the occurrence of the safety end point. The total incidence of bleeding events was 25% and 19% in the dAPT and aspirin-monotherapy groups, respectively (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 2.23, p = 0.33). In the subgroup analysis, dAPT led to lower rates of adverse events in patients with a body mass index >30 kg/m(2) (0% vs 18%, p <0.01) and those <65 years (0% vs 10%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, the addition of clopidogrel in patients found to be aspirin resistant after coronary artery bypass grafting did not reduce the incidence of adverse events, nor did it increase the number of recorded bleeding events. dAPT did, however, lower the incidence of the primary end point in obese patients and those <65 years.
 We evaluated the efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) relative to aspirin in preventing early neurologic deterioration (END), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and outcomes at 6 months.METHODS:  Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous enoxaparin 4000 anti-factor Xa IU/0.4 mL twice daily or oral aspirin 200 mg daily for 10 days. After day 10, all subjects received aspirin 100 mg once daily for 6 months. We assessed whether LMWH was superior to aspirin in preventing END and VTE within the first 10 days after index stroke and evaluated 6-month outcomes.FINDINGS: "FINDINGS" Of the total 1368 patients, 7.89% suffered from END, and 2.85% suffered from deep-vein thrombosis during the first 10 days, with a significance difference between the LMWH group and aspirin group (3.95%, 1.46% versus 11.82%, 4.23%, respectively). At 6 months, there was a significant difference in the frequency of good outcomes among patients over the median age of 70 years (LMWH 63.8% versus aspirin 44.6%). The benefit of LMWH was also significant in patients with symptomatic stenosis of the posterior circulation and basilar artery (75.2% and 82% for LMWH versus 40.5% and 48% for aspirin, respectively).S:  For patients with acute ischemic stroke, treatment with LMWH within 48 hours of stroke until 10 days later may reduce END and deep-vein thrombosis during the first 10 days. LMWH appears to have advantages over aspirin in certain subgroups, such as elderly patients and patients with posterior circulation and basilar artery stenosis.
 Evidence from the literature suggests diminished acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment efficacy in type 2 diabetes (DM2). High on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) in DM2 has been linked to poor glycemic and lipid control. However, there are no consistent data on the association between HAPR and insulin resistance or adipose tissue metabolic activity. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between laboratory response to ASA and metabolic control, insulin resistance and adipokines in DM2.METHODS:  A total of 186 DM2 patients treated with oral antidiabetic drugs and receiving 75 mg ASA daily were included in the analysis. Response to ASA was assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentration and expressed as quartiles of TXB2 level. The achievement of treatment targets in terms of glycemic and lipid control, insulin resistance parameters (including Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR, index), and serum concentrations of high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin and resistin, were evaluated in all patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors of serum TXB2 concentration above the upper quartile and above the median.RESULTS:  Significant trends in age, body mass index (BMI), HOMA-IR, HMW adiponectin concentration, C-reactive protein concentration and the frequency of achieving target triglyceride levels were observed across increasing quartiles of TXB2. In a multivariate analysis, only younger age and higher BMI were independent predictors of TXB2 concentration above the upper quartile, while younger age and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were predictors of TXB2 concentration above the median.S:  These results suggest that in DM2, the most important predictor of HAPR is younger age. Younger DM2 patients may therefore require total daily ASA doses higher than 75 mg, preferably as a twice-daily regimen, to achieve full therapeutic effect. Higher BMI and lower HMW adiponectin concentration were also associated with less potent ASA effect. This is the first study to demonstrate an association of lower adiponectin concentration with higher serum TXB2 level in patients treated with ASA.
 The AVERROES trial name is the following: The Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial demonstrated that apixaban reduced the risk of stroke relative to aspirin, without significantly increasing major bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) considered unsuitable for warfarin therapy. Based on AVERROES trial results, this study compared the medical costs for clinical end points among patients with AF treated with either apixaban or aspirin.METHODS:  Medical costs per patient-year for clinical events were determined. Based on clinical event rates for patients in the AVERROES trial, medical costs excluding drug costs were estimated for apixaban- and aspirin-treated patient groups.RESULTS AND S: "RESULTS AND S" Based on AVERROES trial results, among patients with AF unsuitable for warfarin therapy, apixaban use was estimated to be associated with a mean medical cost avoidance of US$735 in a patient-year relative to aspirin. The primary driver was the significant reduction in ischemic stroke rate. The medical cost reduction associated with apixaban use was consistent in sensitivity analyses.
The safety and efficacy of combined low dose aspirin and warfarin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after mechanical heart valve replacement were evaluated. A total of 1016 patients (620 females, mean age of 36.8±7.7 years) admitted for cardiac valve replacement and complicated with atrial fibrillation after surgery were randomly divided into study (warfarin plus 75-100 mg aspirin) or control (warfarin only) groups. International normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time were maintained at 1.8-2.5 and 1.5-2.0 times the normal values, respectively. Thromboembolic events and major bleedings were registered during the follow-up period. Patients were followed up for 24±9 months. The average dose of warfarin in the study and control groups was 2.91±0.83 mg and 2.88±0.76 mg, respectively (P>0.05). The incidence of overall thromboembolic events in study group was lower than that in control group (2.16% vs. 4.35%, P=0.049). No statistically significant differences were found in hemorrhage events (3.53% vs. 3.95%, P=0.722) or mortality (0.20% vs. 0.40%, P=0.559) between the two groups. Combined low dose aspirin and warfarin therapy in the patients with atrial fibrillation following mechanical heart valve replacement significantly decreased thromboembolic events as compared with warfarin therapy alone. This combined treatment was not associated with an increase in the risk of major bleeding or mortality. 
"" To investigate the short-term time course risks and benefits of clopidogrel with aspirin in minor ischemic stroke or TIA.METHODS:  Data were derived from the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. The primary outcome was a new ischemic stroke. Safety outcomes included any bleeding and moderate to severe bleeding. Time course analyses were performed for the outcomes of both stroke and bleeding.RESULTS:  A total of 145 (71.1%), 13 (6.4%), and 12 (5.9%) of 204 new ischemic strokes in the clopidogrel-aspirin group vs 223 (75.6%), 19 (6.4%), and 8 (2.7%) of 295 in the aspirin alone group occurred at the first, second, and third week, respectively. A total of 23 (38.3%), 15 (25.0%), and 9 (15.0%) of 60 bleeding cases in the clopidogrel-aspirin group vs 15 (36.6%), 8 (19.5%), and 3 (7.3%) of 41 in the aspirin alone group occurred at the first, second, and third week, respectively. Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment numerically reduced the risk of ischemic stroke within the first 2 weeks. From the 10th day, the number of any bleeding cases caused by dual antiplatelets outweighed that of new stroke reduced by dual antiplatelets.S:  Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment may have a benefit of reducing stroke risk outweighing the potential risk of increased bleeding especially within the first 2 weeks compared with aspirin alone in patients with minor stroke or TIA.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00979589" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00979589</a.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: "CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE" This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with minor stroke or TIA, the reduction of stroke risk from clopidogrel plus aspirin within the first 2 weeks outweighs the risk of bleeding compared with aspirin alone.
"" To evaluate the association between low-dose aspirin initiated before conception and the risk of preterm birth.METHODS:  This was a secondary analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial. Women with a history of pregnancy loss (original stratum: one loss less than 20 weeks of gestation during the previous year; expanded stratum: one or two losses with no restrictions on timing or gestational age of the losses) were randomized to either daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg, n=615) and folic acid or folic acid alone (placebo; n=613). Preterm birth was compared between groups using intent-to-treat analysis.RESULTS:  Preterm birth rates were 4.1% (22/535 low-dose aspirin) and 5.7% (31/543 placebo) (relative risk [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.23); spontaneous preterm birth rates were 1.1% (6/535 low-dose aspirin) and 2.2% (12/543 placebo) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19-1.34); medically indicated preterm birth rates were 2.6% (14/535 low-dose aspirin) and 2.9% (16/543 placebo) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.44-1.80). After restriction to confirmed pregnancies using inverse probability weighting, preterm birth rates were 5.7% and 9.0% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.09) and spontaneous preterm birth rates were 1.4% and 3.2% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17-1.18). In confirmed pregnancies in the original stratum, preterm birth occurred in 3.8% and 9.7% of the low-dose aspirin and placebo groups, respectively (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.94).: "" Preconception low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with the overall rate of preterm birth. Although the study was underpowered for this secondary analysis, numeric trends in favor of benefit, particularly in the women with a recent, single early pregnancy loss, warrant further investigation.
"S" The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor pentoxifylline on platelet function profiles in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).BACKGROUND:  Previous studies have shown that, in patients receiving DAPT, the adjunctive use of a PDE inhibitor enhances platelet inhibition, particularly in those presenting with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the PDE inhibitor pentoxifylline on platelet function profiles in DM patients receiving DAPT are unknown.METHODS:  This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel design study conducted in DM patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving DAPT. Patients were randomly assigned to either pentoxifylline 400 mg or placebo 3 times daily for 14 days. The PD effects were assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay, light transmittance aggregometry, VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accumetric, Inc., San Diego, California), and multiple electrode aggregometry at baseline and 14 days. The PD effects were also assessed according the presence or absence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity status.RESULTS:  A total of 40 patients were available for analysis. At 14 days, there were no differences in the P2Y(12) reactivity index as assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation between treatment groups (primary endpoint; p = 0.93). Intra-group comparisons also failed to show any differences between baseline and 14-day P2Y(12) reactivity index assessment in the placebo and pentoxifylline arms (p = 0.61). There were no significant inter- and intra-group differences in all other PD measures. The PD effects did not vary according the presence or absence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity.S:  Adjunctive treatment with pentoxifylline is not associated with increased platelet inhibitory effects in DM patients with coronary artery disease receiving DAPT.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" The effect of aspirin in primary prevention of stroke is controversial among clinical trials conducted in Western countries, and no data are available for Asian populations with a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the risk of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage in the Japanese Primary Prevention Project (JPPP).METHODS:  A total of 14 464 patients (age, 60-85 years) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus participated and were randomized into 2 treatment groups: 100 mg of aspirin or no aspirin. The median follow-up period was 5.02 years.RESULTS:  The cumulative rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke was similar for the aspirin (2.068%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.750-2.443) and no aspirin (2.299%; 95% CI, 1.963-2.692) groups at 5 years; the estimated hazard ratio was 0.927 (95% CI, 0.741-1.160; P=0.509). Aspirin nonsignificantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (hazard ratio, 0.783; 95% CI, 0.606-1.012; P=0.061) and nonsignificantly increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 1.463; 95% CI; 0.956-2.237; P=0.078). A Cox regression adjusted by the risk factors for all stroke, which were age >70 years, smoking, and diabetes mellitus, supported the above result.S:  Aspirin did not show any net benefit for the primary prevention of stroke in elderly Japanese patients with risk factors for stroke, whereas age >70 years, smoking, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for stroke regardless of aspirin treatment.
"" To explore the effect of aspirin on the thermoregulatory responses of men during exposure to 12°C air (acute cold exposure) for a period of 120 minutes and recovery in 25°C air (rewarming) for 120 minutes.METHODS:  Seven male subjects (26.1 ± 2.4 yr) underwent pre-experimental testing to determine peak VO(2) and body composition. Participants underwent 3 trials in which they ingested the following for 1 week prior to each experimental trial: a capsule filled with cellulose (placebo), 81 mg · day(-1) of aspirin (low-dose aspirin), or 650 mg · day(-1) of aspirin (high-dose aspirin). Each trial consisted of a 30-minute baseline period, 120 minutes of exposure to 12°C air, and 120 minutes of recovery in 25°C air. Mean skin temperature and rectal temperature (T(re)) were measured, and heat production was calculated.RESULTS:  During both acute cold exposure and rewarming, analysis of variance revealed a main effect for time (P < .05) with respect to T(re), mean skin temperature, and heat production. However, there were no significant differences between the treatments or treatment by time interactions.S:  These data demonstrate that aspirin had no significant effect on the thermal and metabolic responses during acute cold exposure and rewarming.
 Both new dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT; aspirin and prasugrel) and triple antiplatelet therapy (TAT; aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol) are more potent than classic DAT (aspirin and clopidogrel). We compared the antiplatelet efficacy between new DAT and TAT in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary coronary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).METHODS:  Forty patients who were eligible for primary PCI were prospectively randomized to DAT group (n=20) or TAT group (n=20) immediately after hospital arrival. The primary end point was P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) determined with the VerifyNow P2Y12 point-of-care assay at the time of discharge.RESULTS:  PRU value at discharge was significantly lower in patients receiving DAT compared with that of TAT (84.5 ± 44.7 vs. 128.4 ± 74.9, p=0.032). Percent platelet inhibition was significantly higher for DAT compared with TAT at discharge (72.1 ± 12.2 vs. 57.5 ± 23.5, p=0.020). Inter-patient variability of PRU values at discharge was significantly smaller in patient taking DAT compared with TAT (p=0.026).: "" A new DAT is more potent antiplatelet therapy than TAT in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.
Patients receiving chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and concomitant low-dose aspirin (LDA) are at increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. A fixed-dose combination of enteric-coated (EC) naproxen and immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium (NAP/ESO) has been designed to deliver a proton-pump inhibitor followed by an NSAID in a single tablet. To examine safety data from 5 Phase III studies of NAP/ESO in LDA users (≤ 325 mg daily, administered at any time during the study), and LDA non-users, data were analyzed from 6-month studies assessing NAP/ESO versus EC naproxen in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis (n = 2), 3-month studies assessing NAP/ESO vs celecoxib or placebo in patients with knee osteoarthritis (n = 2), and a 12-month, open-label, safety study of NAP/ESO (n = 1). In an analysis of two studies, incidences of endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers (GUs) and duodenal ulcers (DUs) were summarized by LDA subgroups. In the pooled analysis from all five studies, incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (including prespecified NSAID-associated upper GI AEs and cardiovascular AEs), serious AEs, and AE-related discontinuations were stratified by LDA subgroups. Overall, 2,317 patients received treatment; 1,157 patients received NAP/ESO and, of these, 298 received LDA. The cumulative incidence of GUs and DUs in the two studies with 6-month follow-up was lower for NAP/ESO vs EC naproxen in both LDA subgroups [GUs: 3.0 vs 27.9%, respectively, for LDA users, 6.4 vs 22.4%, respectively, for LDA non-users (both P < 0.001); DUs: 1.0 vs 5.8% for LDA users, 0.6 vs 5.3% for LDA non-users]. The incidence of erosive gastritis was lower in NAP/ESO- vs EC naproxen-treated patients for both LDA users [18.2 vs 36.5%, respectively (P = 0.004)] and LDA non-users [19.8 vs 38.5%, respectively (P < 0.001)]. Among LDA users, incidences of NSAID-associated upper GI AEs were: NAP/ESO, 16.1%; EC naproxen, 31.7%; celecoxib, 22.1%; placebo, 23.2%. Among LDA non-users, incidences of NSAID-associated upper GI AEs were: NAP/ESO, 20. %; EC naproxen, 36.6%; celecoxib, 18.5%; placebo, 18.9%. For LDA users, incidences of cardiovascular AEs were: NAP/ESO, 3.0%; EC naproxen, 1.0%; celecoxib, 0%; placebo, 0%. For LDA non-users, incidences of cardiovascular AEs were: NAP/ESO, 1.0%; EC naproxen, 0.6%; celecoxib, 0.3%; placebo, 0%. NAP/ESO appears to be well-tolerated in patients receiving concomitant LDA. For LDA users, AE incidence was less than that observed for EC naproxen. For most AE categories, incidences were similar among NAP/ESO, celecoxib and placebo groups. The safety of NAP/ESO appeared similar regardless of LDA use.
"S" This study evaluated interaction potential between sugammadex and aspirin on platelet aggregation.METHODS:  This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover study in 26 healthy adult males. Treatments were i.v. placebo, i.v. sugammadex 4 mg/kg, and i.v. placebo/sugammadex with oncedaily oral aspirin 75 mg. Primary objective was to assess interaction between sugammadex and aspirin on platelet aggregation using collagen-induced whole-blood aggregometry. Effects on activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and cutaneous bleeding time were also evaluated. Platelet aggregation and APTT were evaluated by geometric mean ratios, using area-under-effect curves 3 - 30 minutes after sugammadex/placebo dosing. Bleeding time ratio was evaluated at 5 minutes post-dosing. Non-inferiority margins were pre-specified via literature review. Type I error was controlled using a hierarchical strategy.RESULTS:  Ratio for platelet aggregation for aspirin with sugammadex vs. aspirin alone was 1.01, with lower limit of two-sided 90% CI of 0.91(above non-inferiority margin of 0.75). Ratio for statistical interaction between sugammadex and aspirin on APTT was 1.01, with upper 90% CI of 1.04 (below non-inferiority margin of 1.50), and for sugammadex vs. placebo alone was 1.06, with an upper 90% CI of 1.07 (below non-inferiority margin of 1.50). Ratio for bleeding time for aspirin with sugammadex vs. aspirin plus placebo was 1.20, with upper 90% CI of 1.45 (below non-inferiority margin of 1.50). Sugammadex was generally well tolerated.: "" There was no clinically relevant reduction in platelet aggregation with addition of sugammadex 4 mg/kg to aspirin. Pre-determined non-inferiority margins were not exceeded for bleeding time and APTT.
This study sought to compare the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) administration on cardiopulmonary bypass-induced platelet dysfunction in patients who received preoperative aspirin or not. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study, including patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients without aspirin interruption were enrolled in the 'group ASPIRIN' (n = 18) and those who had never been treated with aspirin were included in the 'group NO ASPIRIN' (n = 10). Patients were then randomized to receive either TXA or the same infusion of normal saline. Multiple electrode aggregometry was used to assess platelet function at the different time points throughout the surgery: baseline, post-TXA loading dose, aortic unclamping (End CPB), and 5 min after protamine (Protamine). Compared to those included in the group NO ASPIRIN, patients included in the group ASPIRIN presented a decreased baseline platelet function measured by ASP test (P < 0.01) and collagen test (P < 0.01). In the group NO ASPIRIN, treatment group (TXA vs. placebo) significantly influenced the results for ADP test (P < 0.01), thrombin receptor-activating peptide test (P = 0.01), and ASP test (P = 0.01). We observed that TXA improved platelet function, as measured using multiple electrode aggregometry on ADP test, thrombin receptor-activating peptide test, and ASP test, at the end of CPB (P < 0.05). TXA might decrease the magnitude of platelet dysfunction in aspirin-free patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and assess a potential relationship with clinical endpoints.
We have recently shown that dipyrone (metamizole), a non-opioid analgesic, can nullify aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) antiplatelet effects in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we analysed the aspirin and dipyrone drug-drug interaction in order to identify strategies to prevent the dipyrone induced inhibition of asprin antiplatelet effects. Platelet function was measured by arachidonic acid-induced light-transmission aggregometry, thromboxane (TX) B2- formation by immunoassay. Dipyrone metabolite plasma levels were determined by high-performance-liquid-chromatography (HPLC). In seven healthy individuals, in vitro ASA (30 µM/ 100 µM/ 300 µM/ 1,000 µM) and dipyrone (10 µM) coincubation revealed, that the aspirin and dipyrone interaction can be overcome by increasing doses of aspirin. In 36 aspirin and dipyrone comedicated CAD patients, addition of ASA (30 µM/ 100 µM) in vitro inhibited, but did not completely overcome the dipyrone induced reduction of aspirin antiplatelet effects. Notably, the inhibition of thromboxane formation in aspirin and dipyrone comedicated CAD patients coincided with dipyrone plasma levels. In a cross-over designed study in four healthy individuals, we were able to prove that inhibition of aspirin (100 mg/ day) effects by dipyrone (750 mg/ day) was reversible. Furthermore, aspirin (100 mg/ day) medication prior to dipyrone (750 mg/ day) intake prevented the inhibition of antiplatelet effects by dipyrone in 12 healthy individuals. In conclusion, aspirin medication prior to dipyrone intake preserves antiplatelet effects, circumventing the pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction at the level of cyclooxygenase-1. 
 Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke represents the largest group of cerebrovascular disease, and those patients have a high risk of early recurrent stroke. Over decades, anticoagulation therapy has been used prudently in them for likely increasing the risk of intra-/extra-cranial hemorrhagic complications. However, recently rivaroxaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants, while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, we assumed that patients may benefit from rivaroxaban if treated soon after TIA or minor stroke, and designed this adequately powered randomized study, TRACE.METHODS AND DESIGN: "METHODS AND DESIGN" The Treatment of Rivaroxaban versus Aspirin in Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (TRACE) study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 4400 patients. A 14-days regimen of rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or a 14-days regimen of aspirin 100 mg daily will be administrated to randomized participants with acute TIA or minor stroke, defined as National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores ≤ 3. The primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 14 days. Study visits will be performed at the day of randomization, day 14 and day 90.DISCUSSION: "DISCUSSION" Even though the new oral anticoagulants seem to be both safe and effective, few clinical trials have been carried out to test their effect on non-disabling cerebrovascular events. Treatment with rivaroxaban may prevent more cerebrovascular events with an acceptable risk profile after TIA or minor stroke, compared with aspirin, thus helping to improve the outcome of the disease.
The effect of aspirin desensitization (AD) on immunologic profile of patients with AERD has been poorly understood. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of AD on clinical and immunological markers of patients with AERD. This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial comprised 34 adult patients (67.6% female) with chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and aspirin-intolerant asthma. The active group underwent AD over a 2-day period with increasing doses of aspirin (60, 125, 325, and 625 mg), followed by receiving aspirin 625 mg twice daily for 6 months. Symptom scores and medication needs of patients with AERD who have undergone AD were significantly lower compared to the placebo group after 6 months (7.5 ± 3.5 vs. 10.6 ± 3.8 and 9.3 ± 2.0 vs. 11.0 ± 3.1, respectively, all p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in serum concentration of IL-10, IFN-γ, and TGF-β between two groups neither at baseline nor at the end of study.
Increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors, markers of oxidative stress and insulin resistance during pregnancy have been associated with the development of pre-eclampsia. There is some evidence to suggest that calcium supplement and aspirin can reduce the risk of the disorder. To our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of consumed calcium supplement plus aspirin on high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), oxidative stress parameters and insulin resistance in pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia. This study was designed to investigate the effects of consumed calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin on hs-CRP, oxidative stress parameters and insulin resistance among Iranian pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia. This randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial was carried out among 42 pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia, primigravida, aged 18-40 year old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. Subjects were randomly assigned to received either the placebo (n = 22) or calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin (n = 20) for 9 weeks. Calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin were containing 500 mg carbonate calcium plus 80 mg aspirin. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9 weeks intervention to measure serum hs-CRP, oxidative stress parameters including plasma Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and Total Glutathione (GSH), Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), serum insulin and HOMA-IR score. Consumption of calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin resulted in a significant difference serum hs-CRP levels as compared to the placebo (102.87 vs. 3227.75 ng mL(-1), p = 0.01). Also, mean changes for plasma TAC (68.96 vs. -74.46 mmol L(-1), p = 0.04) and total GSH levels (304.33 vs. -39.33 micromol L(-1), p = 0.03) were significantly different between the two groups. No significant differences were found comparing calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin and placebo in terms of their effects on FPG, serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Within-group differences in the placebo group revealed a significant increase in serum hs-CRP levels (3227.75 ng mL(-1), p = 0.008) and marginally significant increase in plasma total GSH levels (304.33 micromol L(-1), p = 0.07). In conclusion, consumption calcium supplement plus low-dose aspirin during pregnancy for 9 weeks in pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia resulted in a significant difference serum hs-CRP and increased levels of plasma TAC and total GSH as compared to the placebo group, but could not affect serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR score.
"" To investigate the effect of the anti-platelet effect of aspirin plus clopidogrel on off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) grafting and the possible side effects of such therapy.METHODS:  Sixty patients who underwent standard OPCAB were randomized immediately after surgery in two groups: the aspirin alone group of 30 patients who received aspirin (100 mg) daily; and the combination group of 30 patients who received clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (100 mg) daily. Platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid (PLAA) and adenosine diphosphate (PLADP) were measured at baseline (before surgery) and 1-6, 8, and 10 days after the medication. Postoperative bleeding and other perioperative parameters were compared between these two groups.RESULTS:  There were no significant differences between the two groups in perioperative findings including average number of distal anastomosis, operative time, postoperative bleeding, ventilation time, and intensive care unit stay (all P>0.05). The proportion of patients with the PLAA above 20% value was significantly lower in the combination group than those in the aspirin alone group (32.1% vs 62.1%, P<0.05). PLAA of two groups one and two days after taking aspirin or plus clopidogrel were (24.2±31.9)% vs. (49.6±32.6)% and (13.8±27.2)% vs. (37.6±37.4)%, respectively (P<0.05). No obvious postoperative complication was noted in both groups. Multivariate analysis showed that clopidogrel administration was independently correlated with aspirin resistance (P=0.044, OR = 0.09;95% CI=0.07-0.48).: "" Early combined use of aspirin plus clopidogrel after OPCAB can remarkably reduce OPCAB-related aspirin resistance and enjoy similar safety.
Although aspirin is a well-established antiplatelet agent, the mechanisms of aspirin resistance remain poorly understood. Metabolomics allows for measurement of hundreds of small molecules in biological samples, enabling detailed mapping of pathways involved in drug response. We defined the metabolic signature of aspirin exposure in subjects from the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study. Many metabolites, including known aspirin catabolites, changed on exposure to aspirin, and pathway enrichment analysis identified purine metabolism as significantly affected by drug exposure. Furthermore, purines were associated with aspirin response, and poor responders had higher postaspirin adenosine and inosine levels than did good responders (n = 76; both P < 4 × 10(-3)). Using our established "pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics" approach, we identified genetic variants in adenosine kinase associated with aspirin response. Combining metabolomics and genomics allowed for more comprehensive interrogation of mechanisms of variation in aspirin response--an important step toward personalized treatment approaches for cardiovascular disease.
"S" To study whether Clopidogrel-Aspirin combined treatment for high risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke results in increased number of lesions associated with anti-thrombotic cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral micro-bleeds (CMB) than aspirin alone treatment.METHODS:  The patients recruited in CHANCE test in our hospital participated in this study. We made a comparison between treatments Aspirin-Clopidogrel combined group and the Aspirin alone group in the numbers of CMB and subsequent cerebral haemorrhages. In addition, we analysed the association between the increased numbers of CMB and subsequent intracerebral haemorrhages. All 129 patients with high risk TIA with microbleeds or minor stroke within 24 hours after the onset (average age 65.9 ± 9.3, 48.7% were male patients) were divided randomly into two groups: (1) 67 patients were given combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg, then 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days);(2) the rest patients were given aspirin treatment (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75-300 mg on the first day.RESULTS:  The CMB were found in 52.7% of all patients in both groups. There was no siginificant difference between the Aspirin group and the Aspirin-clopidogrel treated group, though the latter showed some slight increase in CMB (Odds ratios (OR) = 1.16, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.54-2.47, P = 0.71). But the numbers of CMB were remarkably associated with the number of primary existing CMB (OR = 6.46, 95%CI 2.57-16.23, P < 0.001), especially that of primary existing CMB ≥  3.In addition, the increasing numbers of CMB associated with primary CMB lesions, which located in corticosubcortical area (CSC) (OR = 4.69, 95%CI 1.51-14.53, P = 0.007).S:  For the treatment of high-risk TIA or minor stroke patients, the clopidogrel-aspirin treatment did not increase the number of CMB than Aspirin alone. It appears that the extent of CMB was associated with the extent of existing CMB occurred in previous stroke, which was mostly located in cortical, subcortical zone.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical value of low‑dose aspirin in combination with Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by measuring follicular peripheral blood flow parameters and the clinical efficacy. The study involved 78 infertile females with PCOS who were randomly divided into experimental (n=38) and control (n=40) groups. The subjects in the experimental group were treated with letrozole in combination with aspirin and Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills, and the control group was treated with letrozole alone. Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the endometrial thickness, pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity (EDV) of the follicular peripheral artery on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The patients who failed to become pregnant in the control group were reintegrated into the experimental group in the subsequent cycle and the clinical effect was observed. In the experimental group, subject perifollicular blood flow was more plentiful, and the PI and RI of the perifollicular blood flow were significantly reduced, while the EDV of the perifollicular blood flow and the rate of clinical pregnancy were markedly elevated compared with the subjects in the control group. Low‑dose aspirin combined with Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills effectively improved perifollicular artery blood flow, and enhanced the oocyte quality and rate of clinical pregnancy. 
 Clopidogrel does not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. As a result, clopidogrel's incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and ulcer bleeding is lower than aspirin's.AIM: "AIM" To compare the healing rate in aspirin-related dyspeptic ulcer patients who were given proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus aspirin or PPI plus clopidogrel.METHODS:  Patients with aspirin-related nonbleeding symptomatic ulcers were randomised to receive rabeprazole (20 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) or rabeprazole (20 mg/day) plus clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the successful treatment of PUD as characterised by intention-to-treat at the end of therapy.RESULTS:  Two hundred and eighteen patients (109 in the aspirin group and 109 in the clopidogrel group) were enrolled. There were no statistical demographic differences between the group that received aspirin and the group that received clopidogrel. The PUD treatment success rate was also statistically equal between the clopidogrel and aspirin groups (86.2% vs. 90.0%, P = 0.531). Neither group experienced ulcer-related bleeding. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that large ulcer size (>10 mm) (OR: 6.29, 95% CI: 2.58-15.37) and past history of PUD (OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.24-10.97) were important predictors of unsuccessful therapy for aspirin-related PUD.
 The protective effect of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular events is attributed to the inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX). However, a recent animal study found a vasodilating and blood pressure lowering effect of aspirin independent of COX, but mediated by inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway.METHOD: "METHOD" Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. In each instance 5 healthy volunteers received either aspirin 500 mg/d or placebo for 7 days. Capillary red blood cell velocity (vRBC) at rest and after postischemic hyperemia was determined on day 1 and 7 by means of nailfold capillary microscopy.RESULTS:  In the aspirin group after 7 days a significant increase of vRBC was found at rest and during hyperemia. In the placebo group vRBC did not change. The finding was confirmed by the cross-over design of the study.: "" Aspirin at a dosage of 500 mg/d has an impact on vasoregulation in the microcirculation. At present, the underlying mode of action in humans is unknown.
Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is characterised by enhanced platelet generation and thrombosis. Once daily (od) aspirin incompletely inhibits platelet thromboxane (TX)A2 production in ET. A twice daily (bid) dosing is necessary to fully inhibit TXA2. Whether this dosing regimen affects in vivo prostacyclin (PGI2) biosynthesis is unknown. PGI2 biosynthesis was characterised in 50 ET patients on enteric-coated (EC) aspirin 100 mg od, by measuring its urinary metabolite, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1α (PGI-M). Moreover, in a crossover study 22 patients poorly responsive to standard aspirin based on serum TXB2 levels (≥4 ng/ml) were randomised to different seven-day aspirin regimens: EC aspirin 100 mg od, 100 mg bid, 200 mg od, or plain aspirin 100 mg od. PGI-M measured 24 hours after the last aspirin intake (EC, 100 mg od) was similar in patients and healthy subjects both on (n=10) and off (n=30) aspirin. PGI-M was unrelated to in vivo TXA2 biosynthesis, and not affected by EC aspirin 100 mg bid or 200 mg od as compared to EC 100 mg od. PGI2 biosynthesis in aspirin-treated ET patients appears unrelated to TXA2 biosynthesis, and not affected by an improved aspirin regimen, demonstrating its vascular safety for future trials. 
In randomized trials, low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) aspirin (ASA) are equally effective in reducing ischemic complications, but HD ASA is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ASA dose after PCI varies across countries, but little is known about variation within the United States (US) and whether this variation can be explained by clinical characteristics of patients. We used enrollment data from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study, a randomized trial designed to compare 12 versus 30 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, to quantify the variation in ASA dosing after PCI in the US subjects and assess the extent to which dose variability was attributable to patient characteristics. Of the 23,336 patients enrolled in the US, 28.0% were prescribed LD ASA at discharge after PCI. Patient characteristics explained 1.6% of total variance in ASA dose, whereas the study site accounted for 45.9% of the unexplained variability. The median odds ratio comparing sites was 5.05 (95% confidence interval 4.29 to 5.85), which was greater than any individual predictor of ASA dose. In conclusion, LD ASA after PCI in the US was used in a minority of patients, and heterogeneity in its selection was mainly influenced by the site of enrollment rather than patient characteristics. As HD ASA may be associated with adverse events in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy, reducing local practice variation in the dose of ASA may be a target for quality improvement. 
 Low-dose aspirin (LDA) frequently causes small bowel injury. While some drugs have been reported to be effective in treating LDA-induced small intestinal damage, most studies did not exclude patients with mild damage thought to be clinically insignificant.AIM: "AIM" We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a high dose of rebamipide, a gastroprotective drug, for LDA-induced moderate-to-severe enteropathy.METHODS:  We enrolled patients who received 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin daily for more than 3 months and were found to have more than 3 mucosal breaks (i.e., erosions or ulcers) in the small intestine by capsule endoscopy. Eligible patients were assigned to receive either rebamipide 300 mg (triple dose) 3 times daily or placebo for 8 weeks in a 2:1 ratio. Capsule endoscopy was then repeated. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of mucosal breaks from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included the complete healing of mucosal breaks at 8 weeks and the change in Lewis score (an endoscopic score assessing damage severity) from baseline to 8 weeks.RESULTS:  The study was completed by 38 patients (rebamipide group: n = 25, placebo group: n = 13). After 8 weeks of treatment, rebamipide, but not placebo, significantly decreased the number of mucosal breaks (p = 0.046). While the difference was not significant (p = 0.13), the rate of complete mucosal break healing in the rebamipide group (32%, 8 of 25) tended to be higher than that in the placebo group (7.7%, 1 of 13). Rebamipide treatment significantly improved intestinal damage severity as assessed by the Lewis score (p = 0.02), whereas placebo did not. The triple dose of rebamipide was well tolerated.S:  High-dose rebamipide is effective for the treatment of LDA-induced moderate-to-severe enteropathy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: "TRIAL REGISTRATION" UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000003463.
 The authors conducted a study to evaluate the effect of combined oral anticoagulant-aspirin therapy on postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing tooth extractions.METHODS:  A total of 213 patients were divided into three groups of 71 participants each. Patients in group A received combined anticoagulant-aspirin (100-milligram prophylactic dose) therapy. Patients in group B received oral anticoagulant therapy. Patients in group C received aspirin therapy (100-mg prophylactic dose). Bleeding was marked as an "event" if it met the following criteria: the bleeding continued beyond 12 hours, patient had to call the surgeon or return to dental practice or emergency department, bleeding resolved with large hematoma or ecchymosis within the oral soft tissues, or required a blood transfusion.RESULTS:  Mean international normalized ratio (INR) (standard deviation) was 2.43 (0.61) in group A, and 2.45 (0.60) in group B. Postoperative bleeding occurred in three (4.2 percent) participants in group A, two (2.8 percent) participants in group B and no (0.0 percent) participants in group C. The authors found no statistical significance in postoperative bleeding between these three groups (χ(2) = 2.867, P = .238). All cases of hemorrhage were controlled easily by using local hemostatic measures.: "" Tooth extractions can be performed safely while patients continue to receive combined anticoagulant-aspirin therapy.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: "CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS" In patients receiving combined anticoagulant-aspirin therapy, simple tooth extractions can be performed safely without discontinuing either oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy if their INRs are within therapeutic range and appropriate local hemostasis measures are provided.
 Dual anti-platelet therapy with clopidogrel and low-dose aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal clinical events. Omeprazole has been shown to significantly reduce these events without compromising cardiovascular safety in patients treated with dual anti-platelet therapy. Whether or not omeprazole improves patient-reported outcomes is undetermined.AIM: "AIM" To assess the impact of prophylactic omeprazole with background dual anti-platelet therapy on patient-reported symptoms of dyspepsia compared to placebo.METHODS:  We analysed results of the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment questionnaires collected in the Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial.RESULTS:  Patient-reported outcome data from 3759 subjects were available for analysis. At 4 weeks, the mean scores of pain intensity and nonpain symptoms were lower in the omeprazole group (5.61 ± 0.17 vs. 6.40 ± 0.17, P = 0.001, and 10.61 ± 0.07 vs. 11.00 ± 0.07, P < 0.001 respectively). These differences were maintained at 24 weeks (5.91 ± 0.35 vs. 7.10 ± 0.37, P = 0.020 for pain intensity; 10.36 ± 0.12 vs. 10.93 ± 0.13, P = 0.001 for nonpain symptoms). After adjusting for covariates there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the percent of patients with dyspepsia during follow-up.S:  In addition to reducing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, statistically significant benefits with prophylactic omeprazole use on both pain and nonpain symptoms were evident at 4 weeks and sustained through 24 weeks. The clinical significance of these overall results is unclear, but greater in patients with pain at baseline.
 . This study aimed to clarify the combinatorial treatment effect of agents as aspirin and ticlopidine associated with vincristine in the management of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP), a severe thrombocytopenic coagulopathy that occurs in the presence of an enlarging vascular tumor such as kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) and tufted angioma (TA).PROCEDURE: "PROCEDURE" . A retrospective review was conducted of medical records of all children with diagnosis of KHE or TA associated with KMP treated with vincristine-aspirin-ticlopidine (VAT) therapy at two different institutions in the same country from 1994 to 2011. Clinical features, response to VAT therapy and outcomes were recorded.RESULTS:  . Eleven patients (mean age 11 months, range 0-36), including seven females (64%) and four males (36%), were identified. Seven patients underwent incisional biopsy and two different histologies were found, KHE in four patients and TA in three patients. Tumors were located in the head and neck (n = 5), chest wall (n = 2), arm (n = 2) and retroperitoneum (n = 2). Mean platelet level was 10,200/mm(3) (range 4,000-21,000). A plaque-like lesion with ecchymosis was the most common cutaneous manifestation (63%). All patients underwent VAT therapy. Mean duration of treatment was 3.9 months for vincristine, 13.9 months for aspirin, and 13.4 months for ticlopidine. All patients are alive with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 2-17).S:  . Antiaggregant therapy is helpful in combination with vincristine in the treatment of KMP associated with KHE and TA. Prognosis is excellent if severe thrombocytopenia is controlled despite failure in reduction of tumor size.
"" We compared the effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone on functional outcome and quality of life in the Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial of aspirin-clopidogrel vs aspirin alone after acute minor stroke or TIA.METHODS:  Participants were assessed at 90 days for functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and quality of life using the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D). Poor functional outcome was defined as mRS score of 2-6 at 90 days and poor quality of life as EQ-5D index score of 0.5 or less.RESULTS:  Poor functional outcome occurred in 254 patients (9.9%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, as compared with 299 (11.6%) in the aspirin group (p = 0.046). Poor quality of life occurred in 142 (5.5%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 175 (6.8%) in the aspirin group (p = 0.06). Disabling stroke at 90 days occurred in 166 (6.5%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 219 (8.5%) in the aspirin group (p = 0.01). In stratified analysis by subsequent stroke, there was no difference in 90-day functional outcome and quality of life between the 2 groups.S:  In patients with minor stroke or TIA, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin appears to be superior to aspirin alone in improving the 90-day functional outcome, and this is consistent with a reduction in the rate of disabling stroke in the dual antiplatelet arm.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: "CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE" This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with acute minor stroke or TIA, clopidogrel plus aspirin compared to aspirin alone improves 90-day functional outcome (absolute reduction of poor outcome 1.70%, 95% confidence interval 0.03%-3.42%).
"" We evaluated the relationship between aspirin supplementation and perinatal outcomes for potential effect modification by smoking status.STUDY DESIGN: "STUDY DESIGN" A secondary analysis of two multicenter trials for which prophylactic aspirin supplementation was given to either low- or high-risk women for prevention of preeclampsia (PE). We examined the effect of aspirin by smoking status using the Breslow-Day test. Primary outcomes for this analysis were PE and preterm birth (PTB) < 37 weeks. We also examined PTB subtypes, small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.RESULTS:  The effect of prenatal aspirin on the risk of PE did not differ by smoking status (relative risk [RR] 95% confidence interval [CI] for smokers; RR 95% CI for nonsmokers) in low-risk (Breslow-Day p = 0.32) or high-risk (RR 95% CI for smokers; RR 95% CI for nonsmokers) (Breslow-Day p = 0.58) women. Among women at low risk for PE, the effect of aspirin supplementation on PTB was not different for nonsmokers (RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.8-1.3]) or smokers (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.4-1.7]), (Breslow-Day p = 0.54). Aspirin was protective for PTB in nonsmokers (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.7-0.9]), but not in smokers (RR 1.1 [95% CI 0.9-1.4]) in the high-risk group (Breslow-Day p = 0.03). Aspirin was also associated with increased spontaneous and early PTB and NICU admission in smokers and not nonsmokers in the high-risk group only.: "" Aspirin supplementation was associated with worse outcomes related to preterm birth in smokers in a high-risk but not low-risk cohort.
"AIM" Evaluation of placental protein 13 (PP13) and risk factors (RFs) as markers for predicting preeclampsia (PE) and use of aspirin for PE prevention.: "" First-trimester pregnancy screening was based on having PP13 level ≤0.4 multiple of the median (MoM) and/or at least one major risk factor (RF) for PE. Management was by routine care or combined with daily treatment with 75 mg aspirin between 14 and 35 weeks of gestation.RESULTS:  Of 820 deliveries, 63 women developed PE (7.7%). Median PP13 levels was 0.2MoM in the PE group compared with 0.83MoM among unaffected and 1.0MoM in unaffected not treated with aspirin (P<0.0001). Low PP13 was a better predictor for PE versus major RFs, particularly for young nuliparous. Combining low PP13 with RFs increased prediction accuracy. Mean arterial pressure (not included in the initial prediction), could add to prediction accuracy when combined with low PP13 and RFs. PE prevention by aspirin was most effective when the risk was determined by low PP13 alone, less effective for combining low PP13 with RFs, and ineffective when determined by RFs alone.: "" When PE risk is determined by low first trimester PP13 or by combined low PP13 and RFs, prevention with aspirin is warranted.
"Context" "UNASSIGNED"Among women with a single, recent pregnancy loss, daily preconception low-dose aspirin (LDA) increased the live birth rate with no effect on pregnancy loss. Ovulation is a potential mechanism underlying this effect.Objective: "Objective" "UNASSIGNED"We estimated the effect of LDA on the per-cycle risk of anovulation among eumenorrheic women.Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily LDA on reproductive outcomes. Preconception follow-up lasted 1 to 6 menstrual cycles (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00467363" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00467363</a).Setting: "Setting" "UNASSIGNED"Four US medical centers during 2007 to 2011.Patients or Other Participants: "Patients or Other Participants" "UNASSIGNED"Healthy women (n = 1214), age 18 to 40, were attempting pregnancy, had regular menstrual cycles (21 to 42 days), and had a history of 1 to 2 documented pregnancy losses, ≤2 live births, and no infertility. All participants completed at least 1 menstrual cycle of follow-up; none withdrew due to adverse events.Intervention: "Intervention" "UNASSIGNED"Aspirin (81 mg) daily for 1 to 6 menstrual cycles.Main Outcome Measure: "Main Outcome Measure" "UNASSIGNED"Per-cycle risk of anovulation, defined as the absence of both a positive spot-urine pregnancy test and a luteinizing hormone (LH) peak (2.5-fold increase in daily urinary LH). Hypothesis formulation preceded data collection.Results: "Results" "UNASSIGNED"Among 4340 cycles, LDA was not associated with anovulation (LDA: 13.4%, placebo: 11.1%; risk ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.52). Results were similar among women with a single, recent loss.Conclusions: "Conclusions" "UNASSIGNED"Daily LDA had no effect on anovulation among women with a history of 1 to 2 pregnancy losses. LDA may affect fertility via other pathways, and these warrant further study.
We studied the ability of a new instrument, the PlaCor PRT that measures shear-induced platelet aggregation in fingerstick, non-anticoagulated blood without added agonists, to detect platelet dysfunction ex vivo. Platelet reactivity time (PRT) and whole blood aggregation (WBA) were measured in 160 healthy volunteers, before and after aspirin and in 170 participants with established vascular disease or risk factors thereof treated with aspirin ± clopidogrel. Pretreatment PRT and WBA were significantly correlated (collagen r = -.63; arachidonate r = -.65; P < .0001). Following aspirin, the mean PRT increased from 82 to 142 seconds (P < .0001), and in participants treated with clopidogrel-aspirin, the mean PRT (286 seconds, n = 65) was significantly longer than with aspirin alone (166 seconds, n = 105; P < .001). Only 13% of PRTs of participants treated with clopidogrel and aspirin were within the normal range. We conclude that the PlaCor PRT is a simple, rapid, point-of-care instrument that compares favorably with published descriptions of other platelet function instruments.
"INTRODUCTION" Aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) mediated thromboxane A2 synthesis. Despite COX-1 inhibition, in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), platelets can be activated through other mechanisms, like activation by thrombin.: "" At baseline in this cross-sectional substudy of the ASCET trial, 1001 stable CAD patients, all on single aspirin treatment, were classified by the PFA100® method, as having high on-aspirin residual platelet reactivity (RPR) or not. Markers of hypercoagulability, endothelial and platelet activation as related to RPR, were evaluated to explore the potential mechanisms behind high on-aspirin RPR.RESULTS:  Altogether, 25.9% (n=259) of the patients were found to have high on-aspirin RPR. S-thromboxane B(2) levels were very low and did not differ between patients having high on-aspirin RPR or not. Patients with high on-aspirin RPR had significantly higher levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) (124 vs 100%, p<0.001, platelet count (236 vs 224 × 10(9)/l, p=0.008), total TFPI (68.4 vs 65.5 ng/ml, p=0.005) and ß-thromboglobulin (ß-TG) (33.3 vs 31.3 IU/ml, p=0.041) compared to patients with low on-aspirin RPR. No significant differences between the groups were observed in levels of endogenous thrombin generation (ETP), pro-thrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), D-dimer, soluble TF (sTF) or P-selectin (all p>0.05).S:  The high on-aspirin RPR as defined by PFA100® seems not to be due to increased thrombin activity as evaluated with ETP, sTF, F1+2 or D-dimer. The elevated levels of platelet count, ß-TG, TFPI and especially vWF might be explained by increased endothelial and platelet activation in these patients.
 Paracetamol is commonly prescribed for first-line symptomatic treatment in patients with osteoarthritis and aspirin is often co-administered for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if an interaction exists between aspirin and paracetamol in regards to gastroduodenal mucosal injury.AIM: "AIM" To investigate whether or not co-administered aspirin with paracetamol results in an increased rate of endoscopic gastroduodenal mucosal injury as compared to either agent alone.METHODS:  In this prospective, double-blind, randomised, three-arm, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group pilot study healthy adult subjects (18-75 years old) with a normal baseline trans-nasal oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (TN-EGD), received oral paracetamol 4000 mg q.d.s. (n = 21), aspirin 325 mg q.d.s. (n = 19) or paracetamol 4000 mg q.d.s. and aspirin 325 mg q.d.s. (n = 20). Upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury was evaluated after 7 days of treatment with TN-EGD.RESULTS:  The rate of gastric ulcers in subjects receiving paracetamol (0/21, 0%) alone or aspirin (3/19, 16%) or both (2/20, 10%) was not different. There were, however, significantly more subjects with one or more lesions (erosion or ulcer) per subject in the paracetamol and aspirin (16/20, 80%) treated subjects as compared to the aspirin (8/19, 42%, P < 0.001) or the paracetamol (3/21, 14%, P < 0.01) exposed subjects. The mean number of lesions per subject was also greater (7.9 vs. 0.7, P < 0.01) in those treated with aspirin and paracetamol compared to paracetamol alone.S:  Co-administration of paracetamol and aspirin was not associated with a significant difference in endoscopic ulcer rates compared to either drug alone. There was a strong signal for increased endoscopic erosions and ulcers in the combined group compared to either aspirin or paracetamol alone.
 Recruitment into large, preconception randomised clinical trials (RCT) is challenging. We describe clinic and community-based preconception recruitment strategies for the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial and highlight approaches that were and were not successful. This longitudinal RCT was conducted at four major sites in the US. Eligible women had one to two prior pregnancy losses and were actively trying to become pregnant.METHODS:  Provider/clinic and community-based outreach strategies were utilised, and the recruitment rate and costs of methods were assessed.RESULTS:  A screening questionnaire was completed by 5485 women; 42.4% (n = 2323) screened were initially eligible, of whom 50.7% (n = 1228) were randomised. Provider/clinic-based recruitment yielded the highest number eligible of those screened (30.1%) and also the most randomised participants overall (40.3%). The next highest yield came from direct mail and brochures/flyers at 13.1% and 12.5% of women randomised, respectively. However, direct mailings cost $720 per participant randomised. Other than word of mouth, provider/clinic-based recruitment was the most cost effective method, costing an average of $60 per randomised participant. Web-based recruitment yielded 4.7% of participants at a cost of $278 per randomised participant.S:  Provider and clinic-based recruitment was the most effective and cost-efficient method of recruitment in a preconception intervention study of reproduction among women.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" Severe atherosclerosis in the aortic arch is associated with a high risk of recurrent vascular events, but the optimal antithrombotic strategy is unclear.METHODS:  This prospective randomized controlled, open-labeled trial, with blinded end point evaluation (PROBE design) tested superiority of aspirin 75 to 150 mg/d plus clopidogrel 75 mg/d (A+C) over warfarin therapy (international normalized ratio 2-3) in patients with ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral embolism with plaque in the thoracic aorta>4 mm and no other identified embolic source. The primary end point included cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, peripheral embolism, vascular death, or intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up visits occurred at 1 month and then every 4 months post randomization.RESULTS:  The trial was stopped after 349 patients were randomized during a period of 8 years and 3 months. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years, the primary end point occurred in 7.6% (13/172) and 11.3% (20/177) of patients on A+C and on warfarin, respectively (log-rank, P=0.2). The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.61; P=0.5). Major hemorrhages including intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 4 and 6 patients in the A+C and warfarin groups, respectively. Vascular deaths occurred in 0 patients in A+C arm compared with 6 (3.4%) patients in the warfarin arm (log-rank, P=0.013). Time in therapeutic range (67% of the time for international normalized ratio 2-3) analysis by tertiles showed no significant differences across groups.S:  Because of lack of power, this trial was inconclusive and results should be taken as hypothesis generating.
Aspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet drug for treatment of a serious vascular event, most notably stroke and myocardial infarction. However, despite the demonstrated benefit of aspirin, significant fraction of aspirin-treated patients may be resistant to the antiplatelet effects of the drug. The possible mechanisms of aspirin resistance (AR) are multifactorial. A genetic basis for AR has been suggested to exist. Therefore, the present study was taken up to investigate the role of -765G/C polymorphism (rs20417) in the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene with AR in stroke patients. Four hundred and fifty stroke patients and four hundred and forty age and sex matched healthy controls were involved in the study. Baseline clinical data were collected and follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with patients at 3 months post event to determine stroke outcome using Modified Rankin Scale. Blood samples were collected and genotypes determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction digestion technique. The association between the genotypes and outcome was evaluated by stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The COX-2 CC and GC genotype showed a significant association with bad outcome. Therefore, the carriers of C allele of COX-2 -765G/C polymorphism are more prone to AR in comparison with non-carriers. These results support a potential role of -765G/C COX-2 gene polymorphism with AR in ischemic stroke patients.
 Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DR-DMF) has cytoprotective and antiinflammatory properties and has recently been approved in the United States as an oral treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The most common adverse events associated with DR-DMF are flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events, the incidences of which diminish over time.: "" The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of DR-DMF with or without concomitant acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor.METHODS:  Healthy volunteers (N = 56) were randomized to receive different dosing regimens of DR-DMF or matching placebo with or without pretreatment with 325 mg aspirin for 4 days. Plasma levels of the active metabolite monomethyl fumarate were assessed on days 1 and 4. Flushing and GI events were assessed using patient-reported scales. Potential flushing mediators were explored.RESULTS:  DR-DMF showed a safety, tolerability, and PK profile consistent with previous clinical experience, with no evidence of accumulation. Pretreatment with aspirin had no effect on the primary PK parameters, AUC0-10h, or Cmax. Flushing severity, assessed by 2 subject-reported rating scales, was generally mild and was rated highest at the start of treatment. Pretreatment with aspirin reduced flushing incidence and intensity without affecting GI events or the PK profile of DR-DMF. In some DR-DMF-treated individuals, plasma concentrations of a prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) metabolite were increased.
Recent studies have suggested that combination antiplatelet therapy may be superior to monotherapy in the treatment of acute stroke. However, additional prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding. The present trial compared the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in the treatment of non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset. Six hundred and ninety patients aged ⩾ 40 years with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were identified for enrollment. Experienced physicians determined baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at the time of admission. All patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive aspirin alone (300 mg/day) or clopidogrel (300 mg for the first day, 75 mg/day thereafter) plus aspirin (100mg/day). The main endpoints were neurological deterioration, recurrent stroke, and development of stroke in patients with TIA within 14 days of admission. After 43 patients were excluded, 321 patients in the dual therapy group and 326 patients in the monotherapy group completed the treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. During the 2 week period, stroke deterioration occurred in nine patients in the dual therapy group and 19 patients in the monotherapy group. Stroke occurred after TIA in one patient in the dual therapy group and three patients in the monotherapy group. Similar numbers of adverse events occurred in both groups. This study showed that early dual antiplatelet treatment reduced early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke, compared with antiplatelet monotherapy. These results imply that dual antiplatelet therapy is superior to monotherapy in the early treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
 Chronic inflammation has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, the associations between plasma inflammatory markers and risk of colorectal cancer have been inconsistent.METHODS:  In a nested case-control study in the Physicians' Health Study, we prospectively investigated the associations of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR-2) with risk of colorectal cancer, and whether aspirin modified these associations among 268 colorectal cancer patients and 446 age- and smoking-matched controls.RESULTS:  In multivariate-adjusted models, plasma levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNFR-2 were not significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer, although a positive trend was observed for TNFR-2 (RR<subhighestvs.lowestquartile</sub=1.55; 95% CI=0.95-2.54; P<subtrend</sub=0.05). We observed a statistically significant association between elevated TNFR-2 levels and colorectal cancer risk in the placebo arm (RR<subhighestvs.lowesttertile</sub=1.77; 95% CI=1.02-3.06; P<subtrend</sub=0.02), but not in the aspirin arm (P<subtrend</sub=0.72). However, the interaction between TNFR-2 and aspirin was not statistically significant (P<subinteraction</sub=0.34).: "" Plasma inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk among men, though there was a statistically non-significant positive trend between TNFR-2 and colorectal cancer risk. More studies are required to understand the relationship between the role of TNFα pathway, aspirin, and colorectal cancer risk.
 Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is associated with high platelet reactivity both in patients who do not receive antiplatelet drugs and in those treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The pathomechanism of this phenomenon has not been fully understood.AIM: "AIM" 1. To evaluate variability of platelet reactivity in patients with DM2 treated with oral antidiabetic drugs and receiving chronic ASA therapy. 2. To identify independent predictors of high platelet reactivity during ASA therapy in patients with DM2.METHODS:  We studied 171 patients with DM2 treated with oral antidiabetic drugs and receiving long-term treatment with 75 mg of ASA daily, selected among the participants of the prospective AVOCADO study. Platelet function was simultaneously evaluated using 4 methods: 1. measurement of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentration; 2. measurement of urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dhTXB2) concentration; 3. VerifyNow® automated analyser; 4. PFA-100® automated analyser.High platelet reactivity was defined as at least 3 of the following criteria: 1. serum TXB2 concentration in the upper quartile;2. urinary 11-dhTXB2 concentration in the upper quartile; 3. value ≥ 550 aspirin reaction units (ARU) by VerifyNow®;4. collagen-epinephrine closure time (CEPI-CT) below median of readings other than 300 s by PFA-100®. In all patients, DM2 control was evaluated, insulin resistance was measured using HOMA-IR, and routine laboratory tests were performed, including full blood count, renal function parameters, and inflammation markers.RESULTS:  Mean patient age was 67.8 years, and median duration of DM2 was 5 years. We found poor agreement between different tests of platelet function. ARU ≥ 550 (VerifyNow®) was found in 14.0% of patients, and CEPI-CT below median of readings other than 300 s (PFA-100®) was found in 32.8% of patients. Our criteria of high platelet reactivity were met by 9.9% of patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of high platelet reactivity despite ASA therapy included chronic heart failure, current smoking, and higher leukocyte count.S:  1. Patients with DM2 are characterised by large variability of platelet reactivity, with little agreement between various methods. 2. Smoking, chronic heart failure, and subclinical inflammation may be associated with high platelet reactivity in patients with DM2 treated with ASA.
"" Low-dose aspirin prevents platelet aggregation by suppressing thromboxane A2 (TXA2 ) synthesis. However, in some individuals TXA2 suppression by aspirin is impaired, indicating suboptimal inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) by aspirin. Because patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have increased risk of thrombotic events, many receive aspirin; however, the efficacy of aspirin in SLE has not been determined. We examined the hypothesis that aspirin response is impaired in SLE.METHODS:  We assessed the effect of aspirin by measuring concentrations of the stable metabolite of TXA2 , serum thromboxane B2 (sTXB2 ), before and after treatment with daily aspirin (81 mg) for 7 days in 34 patients with SLE and 36 control subjects. The inability to suppress sTXB2 synthesis to <10 ng/ml represents suboptimal inhibition of platelet COX-1 by aspirin.RESULTS:  Aspirin almost completely suppressed sTXB2 in control subjects to median 1.5 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 0.8-2.7) but had less effect in patients with SLE (median 3.1 ng/ml [IQR 2.2-5.3]) (P = 0.002). A suboptimal effect of aspirin was present in 15% (5 of 34) of the patients with SLE but not in control subjects (0 of 36) (P = 0.023). Incomplete responders were more likely to have metabolic syndrome (P = 0.048), obesity (P = 0.048), and higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.018).: "" The pharmacologic effect of aspirin is suboptimal in 15% of patients with SLE but in none of the control subjects, and the suboptimal response was associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and higher CRP concentrations.
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin is a widely prescribed regimen to prevent ischemic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A fixed-dose combination (FDC) capsule (HCP0911) has been developed to provide dosing convenience and improve adherence. We compared the antiplatelet effects of single daily dose HCP0911 with separate treatment with daily 75 mg clopidogrel plus 100 mg aspirin. This was a randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover, non-inferiority study conducted in stented patients who had been treated for at least 6 months with clopidogrel and aspirin. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive either daily 75 mg clopidogrel plus 100 mg aspirin treatment or HCP0911 for 2 weeks and then were crossed over to the other treatment for 2 weeks. Pharmacodynamic effects were measured with VerifyNow, light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), and thromboelastography (TEG<sup®</sup). The primary endpoint was P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) measured by VerifyNow. PRUs during treatment with HCP0911 were not inferior to those during separate treatment (202 ± 52 vs. 207 ± 60 PRU; mean difference, -5 PRU; 90% confidence interval of difference, -23 to 13 PRU; P for non-inferiority = 0.015 for predetermined limit). "BASE" and Aspirin Reaction Units by VerifyNow did not differ between the two treatments. During each treatment, there were no differences in maximal and final platelet aggregations by LTA (all P values ≥0.822) and TEG<sup®</sup measurements. In conclusion, in stented patients, the antiplatelet effect of a fixed-dose clopidogrel-aspirin combination, HCP0911, was not inferior to separate administration of clopidogrel and aspirin.
Management of preoperative antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is variable among surgeons: guidelines collide with prejudices because replacement of aspirin with low-molecular-weight heparin is still performed because of a presumed minor bleeding risk. This study aims to analyze postoperative bleedings and complications in patients scheduled for elective primary isolated on-pump CABG, depending on preoperative aspirin treatment or its replacement with enoxaparin. In this cohort study, we propensity score matched 200 patients in whom aspirin was stopped at least 5 days before CABG and replaced with enoxaparin and 200 patients who continued aspirin therapy until the day before surgery. Postoperative bleedings and complications were monitored during hospitalization. Among patients who continued aspirin treatment, mean overall bleeding was 701.0 ± 334.6 ml, whereas in the matched enoxaparin group, it was significantly greater (882.6 ± 64.6 ml, p value <0.001); this was associated with reduced postoperative complications, lower values of postoperative C-reactive protein in aspirin takers, and a presumed protective effect for statins. After propensity score adjustment, aspirin treatment carried a protective effect against major postoperative bleeding (odds ratio 0.312, p = 0.001). In conclusion, postoperative bleeding is reduced in patients who continued aspirin, likely due to a reduction in postoperative inflammation. The practice of empirically discontinuing aspirin and replacing it with enoxaparin before CABG should be abandoned. Patients with coronary artery disease referred to CABG should continue antiplatelet medications until the surgical procedure. Those results might be extended to patients under oral anticoagulant therapy requiring CABG.
"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN" The effects of aspirin on blood pressure (BP) are controversial and a chronopharmacological effect of aspirin on 24-hour BP was reported recently in otherwise untreated hypertensive patients. The study was designed to test the timing effect of aspirin dosing on 24-hour BP in treated hypertensive patients routinely taking aspirin for cardiovascular prevention.METHOD AND RESULTS: "METHOD AND RESULTS" Seventy-five patients were randomized into two groups. One group was to receive aspirin in the evening then in the morning for 1 month and the other group in the morning then in the evening, following a cross-over design. The principal assessment criterion was 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) measured by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Patients were aged 65 ± 9 years and had been hypertensive for 12 ± 10 years. They were all taking a mean of 2.8 antihypertensive drugs and did not modify their treatment throughout the study. Of the included subjects, 70% were men and 33% were diabetics. Mean 24-hour SBP values were clinically equivalent and were not statistically different, depending on whether the aspirin was taking in the morning or evening (128.3 ± 1.4 vs. 128.3 ± 1.4 mmHg, respectively). Neither was there any significant difference in diurnal and nocturnal SBP or in 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal diastolic BP (DBP).: "" It does not appear useful to advise patients with long-standing hypertension to modify timing of aspirin intake in order to reduce BP values.
 Lacunar infarcts are a frequent type of stroke caused mainly by cerebral small-vessel disease. The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention has not been defined.METHODS:  We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial involving 3020 patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel or placebo daily; patients in both groups received 325 mg of aspirin daily. The primary outcome was any recurrent stroke, including ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage.RESULTS:  The participants had a mean age of 63 years, and 63% were men. After a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, the risk of recurrent stroke was not significantly reduced with aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy) (125 strokes; rate, 2.5% per year) as compared with aspirin alone (138 strokes, 2.7% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.16), nor was the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09) or disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.64). The risk of major hemorrhage was almost doubled with dual antiplatelet therapy (105 hemorrhages, 2.1% per year) as compared with aspirin alone (56, 1.1% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.71; P<0.001). Among classifiable recurrent ischemic strokes, 71% (133 of 187) were lacunar strokes. All-cause mortality was increased among patients assigned to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (77 deaths in the group receiving aspirin alone vs. 113 in the group receiving dual antiplatelet therapy) (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.04; P=0.004); this difference was not accounted for by fatal hemorrhages (9 in the group receiving dual antiplatelet therapy vs. 4 in the group receiving aspirin alone).
The risk of acute cardiovascular events is highest during morning hours, and platelet activity peaks during morning hours. The effect of timing of aspirin intake on circadian rhythm and morning peak of platelet reactivity is not known. It was our objective to evaluate the effect of timing of aspirin intake on circadian rhythm and morning peak of platelet reactivity. A randomised open-label cross-over trial in healthy subjects (n=14) was conducted. Participants used acetylsalicylic acid (80 mg) on awakening or at bedtime for two periods of two weeks, separated by a four-week wash-out period. At the end of both periods blood was drawn every 3 hours to measure COX-1-dependent (VerifyNow-Aspirin; Serum Thromboxane B2 [STxB2]) and COX-1-independent (flow cytometry surface CD62p expression; microaggregation) platelet activity. VerifyNow platelet reactivity over the whole day was similar with intake on awakening and at bedtime (mean difference: -9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) -21 to 4]). However, the morning increase in COX-1-dependent platelet activity was reduced by intake of aspirin at bedtime compared with on awakening (mean difference VerifyNow: -23 Aspirin Reaction Units [CI -50 to 4]; STxB2: -1.7 ng/ml [CI -2.7 to -0.8]). COX-1-independent assays were not affected by aspirin intake or its timing. Low-dose aspirin taken at bedtime compared with intake on awakening reduces COX-1-dependent platelet reactivity during morning hours in healthy subjects. Future clinical trials are required to investigate whether simply switching to aspirin intake at bedtime reduces the risk of cardiovascular events during the high risk morning hours. 
"" To evaluate the influence of low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin tablets (100 mg/day for 2 years) on colorectal tumour recurrence in Asian patients with single/multiple colorectal tumours excised by endoscopy.DESIGN: "DESIGN" A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial was conducted.PARTICIPANTS: "PARTICIPANTS" 311 subjects with single/multiple colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas excised by endoscopy were enrolled in the study (152 patients in the aspirin group and 159 patients in the placebo group). Enrolment began at the hospitals (n=19) in 2007 and was completed in 2009.RESULTS:  The subjects treated with aspirin displayed reduced colorectal tumourigenesis and primary endpoints with an adjusted OR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.98) compared with the subjects in the placebo group. Subgroup analysis revealed that subjects who were non-smokers, defined as those who had smoked in the past or who had never smoked, had a marked reduction in the number of recurrent tumours in the aspirin-treated group. The adjusted OR for aspirin treatment in non-smokers was 0.37 (CI 0.21 to 0.68, p<0.05). Interestingly, the use of aspirin in smokers resulted in an increased risk, with an OR of 3.44. In addition, no severe adverse effects were observed in either group.S:  Low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin tablets reduced colorectal tumour recurrence in an Asian population. The results are consistent with those obtained from other randomised controlled trials in Western countries.

Aspirin's prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus is controversial. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and aspirin all affect the cyclooxygenase enzyme. The relationship between plasma EPA and DHA and aspirin's effects has not been determined. Thirty adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus ingested aspirin (81 mg/day) for 7 days, then EPA+DHA (2.6g/day) for 28 days, then both for another 7 days. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) species and more classic platelet function outcomes were determined. Plasma concentrations of total EPA+DHA were associated with 7-day aspirin reduction effects on these outcomes in a "V"-shaped manner for all 11 LPA species and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. This EPA+DHA concentration was quite consistent for each of the LPA species and ADP. These results support aspirin effects on lysolipid metabolism and platelet aggregation depending on plasma EPA+DHA concentrations in individuals with a disturbed lipid milieu.
 Chronic dizziness is frequently reported by patients in the chronic stage after ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cilostazol versus that of aspirin for the chronic dizziness that follows ischemic stroke.METHODS:  We performed a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial. One hundred six patients who suffered supratentorial ischemic stroke within the previous 1-6 months and subsequently complained of persistent dizziness without other obvious sequelae were enrolled. Patients were randomly given cilostazol (200mg/day) or aspirin (100mg/day) for 6 months. Rates of improvement in the dizziness were then evaluated. Changes in fixation suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (an indicator of cerebral control over the brainstem reflex related to balance), regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem; and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were also evaluated.RESULTS:  Dizziness was significantly improved in the cilostazol group versus the aspirin group (P<0.0001) after the 6-month therapy. The capacity for fixation suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex was improved (P<0.0001), and regional CBF in the cerebrum (relative to that in the brainstem [P=0.003] and to that in the cerebello-brainstem [P=0.012]) was increased only in the cilostazol group. There was no statistical difference in the change in SDS scores between the two groups.: "" Cilostazol improves the chronic dizziness that follows ischemic stroke and increases supratentorial CBF and cerebral function for adaptation of the brainstem reflex related to the sense of balance.
Aspirin has been shown to decrease cardiovascular (CV) events by ∼25%. Despite aspirin therapy 10% to 20% of patients with arterial vascular disease develop atherothrombotic events. A meta-analysis of antiplatelet therapy showed a progressive decrease in clinical efficacy of aspirin after 2 years. Whether this is due to a decreased sensitivity to aspirin during long-term therapy remains unclear. A prospective randomized clinical trial with serial monitoring over 5 years was conducted in 100 patients with documented coronary heart disease. We investigated whether long-term treatment with aspirin 50 and 100 mg affects platelet response similarly. Occurrence of CV events was documented. Platelet sensitivity to aspirin, prostacyclin, and adenosine diphosphate-, collagen-, and epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation were evaluated over time. In addition, β-thromboglobulin and inflammatory markers were measured. Four patients were lost to follow-up and 10 patients died. Eleven patients developed nonfatal CV events. In the 2 groups platelet response to aspirin and the referenced variables remained unchanged over 5 years. In patients who developed CV events, the last monitoring interval revealed no difference in platelet response to aspirin. However, patients with nonfatal and fatal CV events showed increased inflammatory markers versus patients without CV events independent of aspirin 50 or 100 mg intake. In conclusion, our study revealed no difference in antiplatelet response to aspirin 50 versus 100 mg or CV events over 5 years in patients with coronary heart disease.
 The mean follow-up in the clinical trials of antiplatelet drugs in the secondary prevention of ischemic atherothrombotic stroke ranges from 1 to 5.5 years. Thus, the safety and efficacy of these drugs in the very long term is not totally documented. We have assessed the safety and effectiveness of triflusal and aspirin for a very long-term period in the secondary prevention of patients with ischemic atherothrombotic stroke.METHODS:  Patients with atherothrombotic ischemic stroke, including TIA, who participated in randomized clinical trials of triflusal versus aspirin were included in the study. The period of recruitment was between 1983 and 1999. After finishing their participation in the clinical trials, patients were followed up in the Neurology Department of our hospital. All patients were treated with aspirin or triflusal during a mean period of 17.2 years. Groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, risk factor and etiology of the stroke. Adverse events and vascular events (including stroke recurrence, ischemic heart disease and vascular death) that appeared throughout the study were registered. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS 15.0 for Windows. Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare treatments.RESULTS:  A total of 441 patients (305 men) with a mean age (±SD) of 51.1±12.4 years were included in the study; 288 patients (65.3%) were treated with triflusal and 153 with aspirin. There were no statistically significant differences between aspirin and triflusal concerning new vascular events (72.5 vs. 60.4%; p=0.28), stroke recurrence (49.7 vs. 46.5%; p=0.53), ischemic heart events (54.9 vs. 55.6%; p=0.90), vascular death (25.5 vs. 24%; p=0.73) and global mortality (42.5 vs. 42%; p=0.92). The incidence of serious bleeding (upper digestive tract hemorrhage and cerebral hemorrhage) was 18.3% in aspirin-treated patients and 5.5% in triflusal-treated patients (p<0.001). In reference to other adverse events, no significant differences were found between aspirin and triflusal.S:  In the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, very long-term treatment with triflusal or aspirin seems to have a similar efficacy, but triflusal is safer with a lower hemorrhagic risk. Triflusal may be an alternative therapy, particularly in patients who present aspirin resistance.
"" The objective was to determine the effect of preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin (LDA; 81 mg/day) treatment on time to pregnancy in women with a history of pregnancy loss.DESIGN: "DESIGN" This was a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were block-randomized by center and eligibility stratum.SETTING: "SETTING" The study was conducted at four U.S.A. medical centers (2007-2012).PARTICIPANTS: "PARTICIPANTS" Participants women aged 18-40 years actively attempting pregnancy, stratified by eligibility criteria: the "original" stratum, women with one loss <20 weeks' gestation during the previous year; and the "expanded" stratum, women with one or two previous losses of any gestational age regardless of time since loss.INTERVENTION: "INTERVENTION" Daily LDA was compared with matching placebo for up to six menstrual cycles of attempting pregnancy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE" Time to hCG detected pregnancy and clinically confirmed pregnancy, analyzed by intention-to-treat, was measured.RESULTS:  Of the 1228 women randomly assigned to LDA (n = 615) or placebo (n = 613), 410 (67%) women receiving LDA achieved pregnancy compared to 382 (63%) receiving placebo, corresponding to a fecundability odds ratio (FOR) of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.33). Among women in the original stratum (n = 541), LDA was associated with increased fecundability compared to placebo (FOR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.62).S:  Preconception-initiated LDA treatment resulted in a nonsignificant increase in fecundability of 14% in women with a history of 1-2 pregnancy losses, and a significant increase of 28% in women with a history of only one pregnancy loss of <20 weeks' gestation in the preceding year. Preconception-initiated LDA may increase fecundability in certain women with a recent early pregnancy loss.
Low-dose aspirin inhibits thromboxane production and augments the sensitivity of carotid baroreflex (CBR) control of heart rate (HR) during concurrent muscle mechanoreflex and metaboreflex activation in healthy young humans. However, it is unknown how aging affects this response. Therefore, the effect of low-dose aspirin on carotid-cardiac baroreflex sensitivity during muscle mechanoreflex with and without metaboreflex activation in healthy older humans was examined. Twelve older subjects (6 men and 6 women, mean age: 62 ± 1 yr) performed two trials during two visits preceded by 7 days of low-dose aspirin (81 mg) or placebo. One trial involved 3 min of passive calf stretch (mechanoreflex) during 7.5 min of limb circulatory occlusion (CO). In another trial, CO was preceded by 1.5 min of 70% maximal voluntary contraction isometric calf exercise (mechanoreflex and metaboreflex). HR (ECG) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; Finometer) were recorded. CBR function was assessed using rapid neck pressure application (+40 to -80 mmHg). Aspirin significantly decreased baseline thromboxane B2 production by 83 ± 4% (P < 0.05) but did not affect 6-keto-PGF1α. After aspirin, CBR-HR maximal gain and operating point gain were significantly higher during stretch with metabolite accumulation compared with placebo (maximal gain: -0.23 ± 0.03 vs. -0.14 ± 0.02 and operating point gain: -0.11 ± 0.03 vs. -0.04 ± 0.01 beats·min(-1)·mmHg(-1) for aspirin and placebo, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings suggest that low-dose aspirin augments CBR-HR sensitivity during concurrent muscle mechanoreflex and metaboreflex activation in healthy older humans. This increased sensitivity appears linked to reduced thromboxane sensitization of muscle mechanoreceptors, which consequently improves CBR-HR control. 
Progressive stroke is a serious problem due to the associated morbidity and mortality. Aspirin is recommended for acute ischemic stroke, but does not reduce the frequency of stroke progression. No standard treatment has been approved for the prevention of stroke progression. Cilostazol, which reduces platelet aggregation about 3 hours after single administration, does not increase the frequency of bleeding events when compared with aspirin or a placebo. Moreover, the combination of 100 mg aspirin and 200 mg cilostazol does not increase the frequency of bleeding events compared with only 100 mg aspirin, and thus is expected to prevent stroke progression with a high degree of safety. The present study investigated the safety of this combination of two drugs administered at the above concentrations in 54 patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours of stroke onset. Modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measurements were performed at baseline and again on day 4 to 7. Progressive stroke was defined as an increase greater than or equal to 1 point on NIHSS. Patient scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were evaluated at baseline and 3 months after enrollment. Stroke progression occurred in 11.1% of the patients. The percentages of patients with mRS score from 0 to 2 were 42.6% and 75% at baseline and 3 months, respectively. No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or major extracranial hemorrhage occurred. These results suggest that administration of aspirin and cilostazol is safe for acute ischemic stroke.
We sought to determine whether cognitive function in stable outpatients with heart failure (HF) is affected by HF severity. A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from 2, 043 outpatients with systolic HF and without prior stroke enrolled in the Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) Trial. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between cognitive function measured using the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and markers of HF severity (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, and 6-minute walk distance). The mean (SD) for the MMSE was 28.6 (2.0), with 64 (3.1%) of the 2,043 patients meeting the cut-off of MMSE <24 that indicates need for further evaluation of cognitive impairment. After adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, 6-minute walk distance (β-coefficient 0.002, p<0.0001), but not LVEF or NYHA functional class, was independently associated with the MMSE as a continuous measure. Age, education, smoking status, body mass index, and hemoglobin level were also independently associated with the MMSE. In conclusion, six-minute walk distance, but not LVEF or NYHA functional class, was an important predictor of cognitive function in ambulatory patients with systolic heart failure. 
 Even though the acetylation of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 at serine-529 is the direct mechanism of action of low-dose aspirin, its antiplatelet effect has been characterized using indirect indexes of COX-1 activity.S: "S" We performed a clinical study with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin (EC-aspirin), in healthy subjects, to evaluate the effects on the extent and duration of platelet COX-1 acetylation, using a novel proteomic strategy for absolute protein quantification (termed AQUA), as compared with traditional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: "SUBJECTS AND METHODS" In a phase I, single-arm, open-label study of EC aspirin (100 mg day(-1) ) administered to 24 healthy subjects, we compared, over a 24 h-period on day 1 and 7, % platelet acetylated COX-1 (AceCOX-1) with traditional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics [i.e. serum thromboxane (TX) B2 , platelet function by monitoring CEPI(collagen/epinephrine) closure time (CT) using whole-blood PFA-100 and urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TXB2 ] parameters.RESULTS:  Acetylation of platelet COX-1 was measurable before detection of aspirin levels in the systemic circulation and increased in a cumulative fashion upon repeated dosing. After the last dose of EC-aspirin, %AceCOX-1, serum TXB2 and CEPI-CT values were maximally and persistently modified throughout 24 h; they averaged 76 ± 2%, 99.0 ± 0.4% and 271 ± 5 s, respectively. EC-aspirin caused 75% reduction in urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion. After chronic dosing with aspirin, the pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was completely dissociated from pharmacodynamics.S:  The demonstrated feasibility of quantifying the extent and duration of platelet COX-1 acetylation will allow characterizing the genetic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic determinants of the inter-individual variability in the antiplatelet response to low-dose aspirin as well as identifying extra-platelet sites of drug action.
 The vascular endothelium secretes a balance of dilator and constrictor substances which regulate vascular tone. During ischemic stress, this balance changes. After a short period of ischemia, a protective mechanism known as reactive hyperemia (RH) contributes to a post-ischemic increase in blood flow. The agents regulating this phenomenon remain controversial.AIM: "AIM" The purpose of this study was to examine whether aspirin regulates vascular endothelial function following ischemia.METHODS:  Sixteen healthy volunteers presented for two visits, each serving as their own control, and randomized to receive 500 mg aspirin or placebo. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured at baseline and during reactive hyperemia (RH) which was induced by five minutes of arterial occlusion. Blood samples were analyzed for vWF and lipids.RESULTS:  After ischemia, RH was attenuated when subjects were pre-medicated with 500 mg aspirin compared to placebo: AUC[aspirin] = 1450 +/- 201 mL/100 mL tissue/min vs. AUC[pIacebo] = 2207 +/- 294 mL/100 mL tissue/min; (p < 0.05). Separation of the subjects with high HDL or low HDL levels resulted in a similar peak FBF response with placebo, but in the high-HDL group only, aspirin ingestion attenuated peak FBF after ischemia compared to the placebo condition (22.6 +/- 1.7 m/100 mL tissue/min vs. 33.5 +/- 3.2 mL/100 mL tissue/min, respectively) (p < 0.05).S:  Aspirin partially regulates the RH response following ischemia compared to placebo, and this effect appears to be more profound when adjusting for plasma HDL concentration in healthy individuals. This suggests that the post-ischemic RH response may be partially mediated by arachidonic acid-derived mediators such as the prostaglandins.
Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is used in patients with low-intermediate chest pain presenting to the emergency department for its reliability in excluding acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, its influence on medication modification in this setting is unclear. We sought to determine whether knowledge of CCTA-based coronary artery disease (CAD) was associated with change in statin and aspirin prescription. We used the CCTA arm of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computed Angiographic Tomography II multicenter, randomized control trial (R-II) and comparison cohort from the observational Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computed Angiographic Tomography I cohort (R-I). In R-II, subjects were randomly assigned to CCTA to guide decision making, whereas in R-I patients underwent CCTA with results blinded to caregivers and managed according to standard care. Our final cohort consisted of 277 subjects from R-I and 370 from R-II. ACS rate was similar (6.9% vs 6.2% respectively, p = 0.75). For subjects with CCTA-detected obstructive CAD without ACS, initiation of statin was significantly greater after disclosure of CCTA results (0% in R-I vs 20% in R-II, p = 0.009). Conversely, for subjects without CCTA-detected CAD, aspirin prescription was lower with disclosure of CCTA results (16% in R-I vs 4.8% in R-II, p = 0.001). However, only 68% of subjects in R-II with obstructive CAD were discharged on statin and 65% on aspirin. In conclusion, physician knowledge of CCTA results leads to improved alignment of aspirin and statin with the presence and severity of CAD although still many patients with CCTA-detected CAD are not discharged on aspirin or statin. Our findings suggest opportunity for practice improvement when CCTA is performed in the emergency department.
 Patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence after anticoagulants are discontinued. Aspirin may be effective in preventing a recurrence of venous thromboembolism.METHODS:  We randomly assigned 822 patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism to receive aspirin, at a dose of 100 mg daily, or placebo for up to 4 years. The primary outcome was a recurrence of venous thromboembolism.RESULTS:  During a median follow-up period of 37.2 months, venous thromboembolism recurred in 73 of 411 patients assigned to placebo and in 57 of 411 assigned to aspirin (a rate of 6.5% per year vs. 4.8% per year; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.05; P=0.09). Aspirin reduced the rate of the two prespecified secondary composite outcomes: the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death was reduced by 34% (a rate of 8.0% per year with placebo vs. 5.2% per year with aspirin; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P=0.01), and the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, or death from any cause was reduced by 33% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91; P=0.01). There was no significant between-group difference in the rates of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding episodes (rate of 0.6% per year with placebo vs. 1.1% per year with aspirin, P=0.22) or serious adverse events.S:  In this study, aspirin, as compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the rate of recurrence of venous thromboembolism but resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of major vascular events, with improved net clinical benefit. These results substantiate earlier evidence of a therapeutic benefit of aspirin when it is given to patients after initial anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism.

 Cerebralcare Granule (CG) is a polyherbal Chinese medicine that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in experimental models of stroke. We compared the efficacy and safety of CG with aspirin in patients with acute stroke.METHODS:  For this open-label, controlled trial, we recruited patients with angiographically confirmed strokes and US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 4-22 within 2 weeks of symptom onset; recruitment was performed at 55 sites in China. Patients received CG or aspirin. The primary efficacy end-point was neurological function. Analyses were done by intention to treat. Patients were measured for NIHSS, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores and Barthel index at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment.RESULTS:  Between January 2013 and January 2014, we treated 1963 patients with CG and 1288 patients with aspirin. Baseline NIHSS, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were comparable between the two groups. Patients in the CG group had a greater improvement than the aspirin group in terms of NIHSS (P < 0.01) and Barthel index at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, patients in the CG group had a greater improvement than the aspirin group in terms of Mini-Mental State Examination (P < 0.01) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (P < 0.05). Adverse reactions were similar between the two groups.S:  This large-scale, controlled trial indicated that CG may be a useful treatment in the management of post-stroke patients.
 The impact of apixaban versus aspirin on ischemic stroke and major bleeding in relation to the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc stroke risk scores in atrial fibrillation has not been investigated.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" In this secondary analysis of the AVERROES trial, our principal objective was to assess the effect of treatment with aspirin or apixaban on ischemic stroke and major bleeding, in relation to the CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores. We found no significant heterogeneity for treatment efficacy on ischemic stroke for apixaban when subdivided by stroke risk strata, based on CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc. Effects were consistent irrespective of baseline risk, and thus, absolute benefits were greatest in the high-risk groups. There was also no significant heterogeneity for apixaban versus aspirin with regard to major bleeding, when subdivided by CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of stroke on aspirin were age ≥75 years, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min, and nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation. Proportions of the study cohort classified as low/moderate/high risk using the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores were 0.3%/71.7%/28.1% and <0.1%/10.5%/89.5%, respectively.S:  In an atrial fibrillation population, apixaban was superior to aspirin for stroke prevention, with similar rates of major bleeding, in the presence of one or more stroke risk factors, with consistency of the treatment effect by CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores.
"AIMS" The GLOBAL LEADERS trial is a superiority study in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, with a uniform use of Biolimus A9-eluting stents (BES) and bivalirudin. GLOBAL LEADERS was designed to assess whether a 24-month antithrombotic regimen with ticagrelor and one month of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), compared to conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), improves outcomes.METHODS AND RESULTS: "METHODS AND RESULTS" Patients (n >16,000) are randomised (1:1 ratio) to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for 24 months plus ASA ≤100 mg for one month versus DAPT with either ticagrelor (acute coronary syndrome) or clopidogrel (stable coronary artery disease) for 12 months plus ASA ≤100 mg for 24 months. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal, new Q-wave myocardial infarction at 24 months. The key safety endpoint is investigator-reported class 3 or 5 bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definitions. Sensitivity analysis will be carried out to explore potential differences in outcome across geographic regions and according to specific angiographic and clinical risk estimates.S:  The GLOBAL LEADERS trial aims to assess the role of ticagrelor as a single antiplatelet agent after a short course of DAPT for the long-term prevention of cardiac adverse events, across a wide spectrum of patients, following BES implantation.
As the key point of function for aspirin to educe anti-platelet effects, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) gene polymorphisms have long been suspected as a potential cause for aspirin nonresponsiveness. But this hypothesis has not been confirmed by large longitudinal studies. This study prospectively evaluated the impacts of COX-1 gene polymorphisms on stroke recurrence and other vascular events in a large cohort of Chinese patients with ischemic stroke and treated with aspirin. Between December 2009 and October 2012, consecutive patients with ischemic stroke and treated with aspirin were enrolled. Polymorphisms of four alleles (rs1330344, rs10306114, rs3842788 and rs5788) in COX-1 gene were determined at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from cardiovascular causes. Impacts of COX-1 gene polymorphisms on vascular outcomes were evaluated with multivariate analysis. A total of 859 patients were included in data analysis. The minor allele frequencies of rs1330344, rs10306114, rs3842788 and rs5788 were 38.53%, 0.12%, 6.64% and 5.53%, respectively. During 14.64 ± 7.44 months of follow-up, primary endpoint was observed in 67 (7.80%) patients. Incidence of primary endpoint was higher in patients with CC genotype of rs1330344 than in patients with CT or TT genotype (HR=1.916, 95% CI: 1.126-3.260, P=0.016). After being adjusted for potential confounding factors, rs1330344 CC genotype was still independently associated with incidence of primary endpoint (HR=1.958, 95% CI: 1.151-3.332, P=0.013). The impacts of other three tested polymorphisms on primary endpoint were unremarkable. In conclusion, in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke and treated with aspirin, CC genotype of rs1330344 may increase the risk of subsequent vascular events.
The prescription of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to this drug could prove harmful. The aim of the study was to assess the antiplatelet activity and safety of a combined antiplatelet treatment with indobufen and clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with hypersensitivity to aspirin, undergoing coronary stenting. Forty-two consecutive ACS patients treated with stent implantation were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily (loading dose 300 mg) plus indobufen 100 mg twice a day (group A), or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, after 300 mg of loading dose (group B). Platelet activity and safety were monitored in both groups at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months with laboratory and clinical evaluation. A lower value of max % platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid and collagen was found in group A compared to group B (31.79 ± 27.33 vs. 73.67 ± 19.92; p < 0.0001 and 28.53 ± 21.32 vs. 73.58 ± 17.71; p < 0.0001, respectively). There was no difference in max % of platelet inhibition to adenosine diphosphate between the two groups (14.23 ± 18.92 vs. 10.30 ± 18.97; p = 0.23). In the population that was under indobufen treatment, the serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production at 1 week and 1 month was very low (2.6 ± 1.6 ng/ml and 3.0 ± 2.7 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.82). The combined treatment was well tolerated in group A patients. This study suggests that the combined antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and indobufen could be a good option in ACS patients with hypersensitivity to aspirin undergoing coronary stenting.
 Atrial fibrillation (AF) contributes to a prothrombotic state through platelet activation. It is unclear whether increased platelet aggregability in patients with AF is caused by the underlying cardiovascular condition rather than the arrhythmia per se. We investigated the effect of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) on platelet reactivity after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01159639" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT01159639</a) based on patients undergoing elective primary CABG. Patients were dichotomized according to POAF. Postoperative platelet function testing with arachidonic acid as the platelet agonist (ASPI test) was used to define high on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR). ΔASPI presented the difference between pre- and postoperative ASPI test values. To account for the isolated effect of POAF on platelet reactivity, a propensity score analysis was applied.RESULTS:  Overall incidence of POAF was 23% (92 of 398 patients). HAPR was detected in 54% (214 of 398) of patients. HAPR was more prevalent among patients with POAF when compared with patients without POAF (64.1% versus 50.7%; odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.82; p = 0.023). The propensity score model produced a subcohort of patients that was well balanced for comorbidities. When compared with the matched group without POAF, the POAF group maintained its prevalence for HAPR (64.1% versus 45.7%; OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.18-3.85; p = 0.012) and had greater ΔASPI values (15.0 [IQR, 0.0-36.0] vs 8.0 [IQR, -5.5-19.5]; p = 0.030).S:  The main finding of our study indicates there is added platelet activation in patients with POAF after CABG before and after controlling for pathologic conditions through propensity matching. The present study does not prove a causal association between POAF and HAPR.
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE" In patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large artery atherosclerosis, clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone might be more effective to prevent recurrent cerebral ischemia. However, there is no clear evidence.METHODS:  In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized 358 patients with acute ischemic stroke of presumed large artery atherosclerosis origin within 48 hours of onset to clopidogrel (75 mg/d without loading dose) plus aspirin (300-mg loading followed by 100 mg/d) or to aspirin alone (300-mg loading followed by 100 mg/d) for 30 days. The primary outcome was new symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic lesion on magnetic resonance imaging within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day functional disability, clinical stroke recurrence, and composite of major vascular events. Safety outcome was any bleeding.RESULTS:  Of 358 patients enrolled, 334 (167 in each group) completed follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. The 30-day new ischemic lesion recurrence rate was comparable between the clopidogrel plus aspirin and the aspirin monotherapy groups (36.5% versus 35.9%; relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.35; P=0.91). Of the recurrent ischemic lesions, 94.2% were clinically asymptomatic. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the 2 groups. Any bleeding were more frequent in the combination group than in the aspirin monotherapy group, but the difference was not significant (16.7% versus 10.7%; P=0.11). One hemorrhagic stroke occurred in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group.S:  Clopidogrel plus aspirin might not be superior to aspirin alone for preventing new ischemic lesion and clinical vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large artery atherosclerosis.
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), a severe eosinophilic inflammatory disorder of the airways, involves overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), activation of airway mast cells (MCs), and bronchoconstriction in response to nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors that deplete homeostatic PGE2. The mechanistic basis for MC activation in this disorder is unknown. We now demonstrate that patients with AERD have markedly increased epithelial expression of the alarmin-like cytokine IL-33 in nasal polyps, as compared with polyps from aspirin-tolerant control subjects. The murine model of AERD, generated by dust mite priming of mice lacking microsomal PGE2 synthase (ptges(-/-) mice), shows a similar upregulation of IL-33 protein in the airway epithelium, along with marked eosinophilic bronchovascular inflammation. Deletion of leukotriene C4 synthase, the terminal enzyme needed to generate cysLTs, eliminates the increased IL-33 content of the ptges(-/-) lungs and sharply reduces pulmonary eosinophilia and basal secretion of MC products. Challenges of dust mite-primed ptges(-/-) mice with lysine aspirin induce IL-33-dependent MC activation and bronchoconstriction. Thus, IL-33 is a component of a cysLT-driven innate type 2 immune response that drives pathogenic MC activation and contributes substantially to AERD pathogenesis. 
 Several lines of evidence suggest that male embryos may have greater vulnerability than female embryos to disordered inflammation; therefore, antiinflammatory drugs, such as low-dose aspirin (LDA), may alter the sex ratio. Here, we assessed the effect of LDA on male live birth and male offspring, incorporating pregnancy losses (n = 56) via genetic assessment, as part of a parallel-design, block-randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preconception LDA.METHODS:  Participants (615 treated with LDA, 613 treated with placebo) ranged in age from 18 to 40 years of age, with 1 to 2 prior pregnancy losses. We estimated the intention-to-treat (ITT) risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI and assessed interaction with baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) serum concentration - a marker of systemic inflammation.RESULTS:  Among the 1,078 women who completed follow-up (535 treated with LDA, 543 treated with placebo), the male live birth ITT RR equaled 1.31 (95% CI: 1.07-1.59). With increasing tertile of hsCRP, the proportion of males at birth decreased in the placebo group, and the effect of LDA on male live birth increased (first tertile: 48% male in LDA vs. 52% in placebo, ITT RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.70-1.35; second tertile: 57% male in LDA vs. 43% in placebo, ITT RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.98-1.90; third tertile: 53% male in LDA vs. 35% in placebo, ITT RR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.13-2.57; P interaction = 0.03). Analysis of pregnancy with male offspring yielded similar results.: "" Initiation of LDA prior to conception restored numbers of male live births and pregnancy with male offspring among women with 1 to 2 prior pregnancy losses. Moreover, our data suggest that LDA modulates inflammation that would otherwise reduce the conception or survival of male embryos.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00467363" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov" NCT00467363</a.FUNDING: "FUNDING" Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health.
 Low-dose aspirin is widely recommended for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, it remains uncertain whether long-term treatment adversely affects renal function in patients with diabetes. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin affects renal dysfunction in patients with diabetes.METHODS:  We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) trial, to evaluate low-dose aspirin as primary prevention for CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes. We followed the patients with negative urine dipstick albumin of the JPAD trial in a cohort study after the RCT period was completed. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 mg or 100 mg daily, aspirin group) or no aspirin (no aspirin group). After the RCT, the treating physician decided whether to administer aspirin. We evaluated the incidence of positive urine dipstick albumin and annual changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).RESULTS:  Positive urine dipstick albumin developed in 297 patients in the aspirin group (n = 1,075) and 270 patients in the no aspirin group (n = 1,098) during follow-up (median, 8.5 years). Intention-to-treat analysis showed low-dose aspirin did not increase the incidence of positive urine dipstick albumin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.995-1.38). On-treatment analysis yielded similar results (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28). Multivariable analysis showed the incidence of positive urine dipstick albumin was higher among the elderly and those with elevated serum creatinine, high hemoglobin A1c, or high blood pressure; however, low-dose aspirin did not increase the risk of positive urine dipstick albumin. There were no significant differences in annual changes in eGFR between the groups (aspirin, -0.8 ± 2.9; no aspirin, -0.9 ± 2.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year).: "" Long-term low-dose aspirin does not affect eGFR and positive urine dipstick albumin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
 Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of line-of-duty fatality for firefighters. Aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in men and may reduce fatalities in older (>40 yr) firefighters. We hypothesized that both chronic and acute aspirin supplementation would improve vascular function after live firefighting but that chronic supplementation would also improve resting hemodynamics.METHODS:  Twenty-four firefighters (40-60 yr) were randomly assigned to acute or chronic aspirin supplementation or placebo in a balanced, crossover design. Arterial stiffness, brachial and central blood pressures, as well as forearm vasodilatory capacity and blood flow were measured at rest and immediately after live firefighting.RESULTS:  Total hyperemic blood flow (area under the curve (AUC)) was increased (P < 0.001) after firefighting with no effects for aspirin supplementation or acute versus chronic administration (AUC, from 107 ± 5 to 223 ± 9 in aspirin condition and from 97 ± 5 to 216 ± 7 mL·min⁻¹ per 100-mL forearm tissue for placebo; P < 0.05 for main, and P > 0.05 for interaction). Arterial stiffness/central blood pressure increased (P < 0.04) with no effect of aspirin (from 0.0811 ± 0.001 to 0.0844 ± 0.003 m·s·mm⁻¹ Hg⁻¹ in aspirin condition versus 0.0802 ± 0.002 to 0.0858 ± 0.002 m·s⁻¹·mm Hg⁻¹ in placebo condition), whereas peripheral and central systolic and pulse pressures decreased after firefighting across conditions (P < 0.05).S:  Live firefighting resulted in increased AUC and pressure-controlled arterial stiffness and decreased blood pressure in older firefighters, but aspirin supplementation did not affect macro- or microvascular responsiveness at rest or after firefighting.
Increased mucosal polyamine levels and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity are associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia and aspirin treatment reduces risk. Previous studies suggest that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the ODC gene (rs2302615) may be associated with adenoma risk and/or response to aspirin chemoprevention. However, a comprehensive investigation of common genetic variation in the region of ODC gene is lacking. Using a tag SNP approach, we investigated associations between genotype or haplotype and adenoma risk among a cohort of 792 non-Hispanic white participants in a randomized trial of aspirin. Generalized linear regression was used to compute relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for age and sex. The false discovery rate was used to account for multiple testing. Interactions terms were used to assess whether genotype modified the effect of aspirin treatment. Of 15 SNPs analyzed, seven were statistically significantly associated with adenoma risk. However, in multiple SNP regression models, only two of these, located downstream of the gene, were independently associated with risk: rs11694911 (RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08-1.53; P = 0.005) and rs2430420 (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40; P = 0.022). In addition, there was evidence that rs2430420 and rs28362380 modified the effect of aspirin treatment, whereas the previously investigated SNP, rs2302615, had no statistically significant main effect or interaction with aspirin treatment. Our findings suggest that common genetic variants located downstream (3') of the ODC gene influence risk of colorectal adenoma and may also impact the efficacy of aspirin chemoprevention.
 Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is diagnosed through graded aspirin challenges that induce hypersensitivity reactions and eicosanoid level changes. It is not known whether diagnostically useful changes also occur after low-dose aspirin challenges that do not induce hypersensitivity reactions.: "" To investigate the utility of low-dose oral aspirin challenges for diagnosing AERD by measuring different clinical parameters and eicosanoid changes.METHODS:  Sixteen patients with AERD and 13 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma underwent oral challenges with low-dose (20 or 40 mg) aspirin and diagnostic oral graded aspirin challenges (up to 325 mg of aspirin). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, nasal peak flow, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and eicosanoid levels in plasma and urine were analyzed.RESULTS:  In patients with AERD but not in those with aspirin-tolerant asthma, 40-mg aspirin challenges induced a significant mean (SEM) decrease from baseline in FeNO (19% [5.1%]; P = .001) without causing any hypersensitivity reaction. The FeNO decrease also occurred after higher-dose aspirin challenges (27.8% [4.9%]; P < .001). The sensitivity and specificity of 40-mg aspirin-induced FeNO changes for identifying AERD were 90% and 100% with an area under the curve of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92-1.00). The low-dose challenge also induced a significant leukotriene E4 urine increase in patients with AERD (from 6.32 [0.08] to 6.91 [0.15] log-pg/mg creatinine; P < .001), but the sensitivity and specificity of these changes were less than for the FeNO changes.: "" The low-dose aspirin-induced decrease in FeNO in patients with AERD may be useful for the diagnosis of aspirin allergy without inducing a hypersensitivity reaction.
