# Amorpha_V10
Amorpha version 10 does not have visible graph-based functionality. 
Sematic functionality, such as sematic attributes assignment and generation of semantic database, was also not included in V10. 
However, V10 was proved to be very useful in routine activities related to medical data analysis and medical writing. 

All graph-based features are implemented in Amorpha version 9, which is currently not an open source program.
